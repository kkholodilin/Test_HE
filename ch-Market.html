<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Introduction</h2>
<p>This chapter is devoted to the market of such a specific good as housing. The housing market possesses the standard elements of any market: supply, demand, and the price that equalizes them. Since the housing is a durable good, the housing market can be divided into the primary (newly built housing) and secondary (used housing) markets. In addition, due to its relative expensiveness —the purchasing price can be many times higher than the annual income of the household— not everybody can afford buying a dwelling. This leads to a distinction between the owner- and tenant-occupied housing. At the same time, the housing is not an ordinary good. It is characterized by large complexity and heterogeneity. The immobile nature of housing creates strong dependence of its value on the place, where it is situated. All in all, the specificity of housing makes it an exciting object of investigation.</p>
<p>This chapter is organized as follows. Section <a href="ch-Market.html#sec:HousingImportance">3.2</a> serves as motivation for this chapter, for it demonstrates the importance of housing from the socio-economic standpoint.In section <a href="ch-Market.html#sec:Market">3.3</a> we will focus on the specific features of housing as a good: heterogeneity, immobility, durability, and expensiveness. Sections <a href="ch-Market.html#sec:Demand">3.4</a>  and <a href="ch-Market.html#sec:Supply">3.5</a> consider the housing demand and supply, respectively. In section <a href="ch-Market.html#sec:Prices">3.6</a>, the housing prices and their long-term dynamics are discussed. Section <a href="ch-Market.html#sec:Equilibrium">3.7</a> presents a stock-flow model of the housing market unifying all its aspects: the demand; the supply; and the housing price or rent that equate supply and demand. Section <a href="ch-Market.html#sec:Availability">3.8</a> is devoted to the availability of housing in various countries and compares them to Russia. In section <a href="#sec:Vacancy"><strong>??</strong></a>, such measure of excess supply as housing vacancy is examined. Section <a href="#sec:Affordability"><strong>??</strong></a> deals with the affordability of housing, that is, the ability of households to buy or rent a home.<!----></p>
</div>
<div id="sec:HousingImportance" class="section level2" number="3.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.2</span> The importance of housing</h2>
<p>The housing represents a large share of wealth of private households. Households spend a large part of their current expenses on housing. People, especially in countries with severe climate, stay most time in buildings. In addition, housing often serves as a symbol of status.</p>
<p>In Russia, the housing has a particular importance. The main issue is the very insufficient availability of affordable and high-quality housing in Russia. The availability of housing (as measured by the living space per head) in Russia is two times smaller than in Western Europe and almost three times smaller than in the USA (see section <a href="ch-Market.html#sec:Availability">3.8</a>). This problem is aggravated by the fact that the housing affordability (as measured by the ratio of incomes of an average household to the income it must have to purchase a standard dwelling using a mortgage loan provided at standard conditions) in Russia is, for example, four times lower than in the USA <span class="citation">(Гусев <a href="#ref-Gusev_2008" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>This is confirmed by the results of the opinion surveys, which show that the most important problems of Russian citizens at the national level are: high housing prices, high utilities prices, and a near impossibility to buy housing.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
</div>
<div id="sec:Market" class="section level2" number="3.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.3</span> Housing market</h2>
<p>The housing as a good has several specific features that distinguish it from other goods. First, <em>housing is very heterogeneous</em> — it differs a lot in terms of size, layout, equipment, state, and location. Second, the <em>housing is immobile</em> — it is impossible (without huge expenses) to move it in space. There some exceptions, like boat houses (e.g., in Amsterdam, Berlin, and Paris) and mobile homes (widely spread in the USA). Third, the <em>housing is durable</em> — normally, it can be used for decades. The exceptions include temporary housing and huts of nomad people (e.g., iglu or yurt). Fourth, the <em>housing is very expensive</em> — it accounts for a large share of consumption and wealth of private households. Fifth, the <em>costs of moving are very high</em>: large financial and socio-psychological costs are associated with changing the residence, especially if people move between for a long distance.</p>
<div id="heterogeneity-of-housing" class="section level3" number="3.3.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.3.1</span> Heterogeneity of housing</h3>
<p>The housing is a highly heterogeneous good — it varies a lot across different dimensions. The housing value can be represented as a combination of contributions of its features. Typically, two major types of housing characteristics are distinguished: <em>structural</em> and <em>locational</em>. The structural characteristics refer to the physical condition of the dwelling itself and the building wherein it is located. They include the size (e.g., total and living area, the number of rooms, the number of floors in the building as well as the floor in which the dwelling is located, the area of the land plot), the layout (e.g., several small rooms vs. one large room, connected or isolated rooms, joined or separate WC and bathroom, availability of balcony or loggia, etc.), the equipment (e.g., built-in kitchen, central or individual heating, air conditioning), the state (e.g., newly built vs. completely worn-out, luxury vs. poor), construction materials, and the energy consumption and type of energy.</p>
<p>The locational characteristics describe all features of the housing related to its geographical location. They include the accessibility (e.g., the distance or the travel time to the central business district, the proximity to roads or public transit stops and stations), the socio-economic situation in the neighborhood (the income and cultural level, the unemployment and the crime rate in the neighborhood or city district in which the dwelling is located), the natural environment (the quality of air, the availability of the green spaces, the proximity of the sources of environmental pollution, the incidence of various diseases), and the state of neighbor houses (how well the nearby houses and adjacent land plots are kept).</p>
<p>One related feature of the housing market is the information asymmetry between the seller and buyer of the housing. In case of such a complex and heterogeneous good, it is virtually impossible for the buyer to figure out all its relevant characteristics before he buys and starts to use it. Even then, some hidden deficiencies can be discovered only years after. These include, for example, the fungus of the walls (structural characteristics) or the fact that nearby railway station is going to be shut down in a few years (locational characteristics).</p>
</div>
<div id="immobility-of-housing" class="section level3" number="3.3.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.3.2</span> Immobility of housing</h3>
<p>In most cases, the housing is immobile, meaning that it is prohibitively difficult and expensive to move it from one place to another. Therefore, the real estate agents often joke that the three main factors affecting house prices are: location, location, and location. However, this joke contains a big grain of truth. Indeed, in many cases the value of the dwelling can be up to a half dependent on its location.</p>
<p>The heterogeneity of housing implies a high degree of segmentation of housing markets. The housing submarkets are delineated by such characteristics as size, location, and quality. The local markets can be quite isolated from each other, especially if they are divided by the natural (rivers, mountains, etc.) or human made (railroads, highways, etc.) barriers. Such local isolation produces spatial heterogeneity of housing (local submarkets differ from each other, especially in terms of the price) and spatial dependence (the dwellings located next to each other are more related in terms of their values than dwellings located far apart). Section  elaborates more on these issues and how they can be tackled with in order to accurately assess the value of the real estate.</p>
</div>
<div id="durability-of-housing" class="section level3" number="3.3.3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.3.3</span> Durability of housing</h3>
<p>The housing is a very durable good. It can serve for various decades or even centuries. However, over time, the housing wears and tears. Therefore, from time to time a refurbishment is needed.</p>
<p>The number of existing dwellings or their area is called <strong>housing stock</strong>. The housing stock grows mainly through the new construction. Some part of housing is removed from the market. First, dwellings are converted to non-residential uses (e.g., offices, doctor’s practices). Second, the owners simply do not use it and leave vacant (empty) as a so-called "concrete purse’’. This is done especially during the housing market booms, when the prices for housing increase, and the market participants expect to sell it at a later stage with a profit. In such a case, renting out of the housing is regarded as something burdensome. Third, when housing is worn out and not well maintained, it decays and becomes uninhabitable. Fourth, the housing is demolished, because it is too worn out or it is considered as an obstacle for the new developments (construction of new streets or larger buildings).</p>
<p>One interesting phenomenon related to the durability of housing is the so-called <strong>filtering down</strong>. It means a transition of housing from the more expensive into a cheaper segment due to wear and obsolescence. Typically, the housing market is very segmented by different dimensions. One of the dimensions is the quality of housing. The higher-quality dwellings are more expensive and, therefore, are used by the better off persons, while lower-quality dwellings are inhabited by the poor people. Often, the investors are more interested in constructing high-quality dwellings that offer higher profits than the dwellings for poor. This can create problems with availability of affordable housing, since people with lower incomes are more populous. However, the good news is that the high-quality dwellings constructed years before through the wear and tear descend into the lower-quality segment. The rich people leave these dwellings and more into the newly built ones, whereas poor people can move in these "filtered down’’ dwellings. This process —at least to some extent— mitigates the housing affordability issue.</p>
</div>
<div id="housing-is-expensive" class="section level3" number="3.3.4">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.3.4</span> Housing is expensive</h3>
<p>Another important feature of the housing is its high price. Despite all the standardization of the building materials and streamlining of the construction process, the modern housing is very expensive.</p>
<p>The housing price by far and large exceeds the current income of the household. It can well be 3–4 times larger than the annual income. Therefore, the housing is mainly bought with borrowed money. This can be dangerous, if the dwelling is bought at a peak of a housing boom, which is followed by an abrupt price fall.<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> In such a case, many house buyers with low or uncertain incomes can default and lose their property. In some countries, e.g., in Germany, the liability of mortgage debtors does not end with the sale of the house, instead the whole their wealth must be used to pay out their debts. If many people cannot fulfill their debt obligations, then the banks, which lent them money, get into troubles. Due to a strong interdependence of the banks this can lead to a systemic crisis of the whole banking system, which, in turn, can trigger a full-fledged economic downturn. This is a scenario that took place in 2008–2009 first in the USA and then in many other countries.</p>
<p>The fact that the housing is very expensive generates a divide between people: some of them, who have another money to buy a dwelling, become homeowners, while the others must live in a rented housing. The choice between the own and the rental housing is known as a tenure choice. In more detail it will be considered in Chapter <a href="ch-Tenure.html#ch:Tenure">6</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, the housing makes up the largest part of the private wealth. This means that the assets of the private households are mainly invested in their housing and, thus, are not really diversified. For example, in Germany, it accounts for more than a half of the wealth of private households. It share is well above the proportion of other assets, including cash and securities. In China, the proportion of the housing in the total wealth is even higher, corresponding to approximately 70%<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a>
In Sweden, during the post-WWII period, the housing accounted for 50–75% of the wealth of private households <span class="citation">(Berg <a href="#ref-Berg_1988" role="doc-biblioref">1988</a>)</span>.

<p>While until the mid-19th century, the agricultural land in France used to be the largest asset, by the end of the 20th century the housing turned into the largest wealth component.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="sec:Demand" class="section level2" number="3.4">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.4</span> Demand for housing</h2>
<p>As in any other market, the effective demand for housing depends on the number of individuals requiring it and on their purchasing power. In case of the housing market, the individuals requiring dwellings are households. According, for example, to the definition of Rosstat, "a household is a group of persons living in the same residential premises or part of them, who jointly provide themselves with food and all necessary stuff for their life, and completely or in part join and spend their money. These persons can can be unified by the kinship relations and relationships resulting from marriage, or do not be relatives, or be either one or another’’.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>Therefore, the demand for housing depends basically on the demographic factors and disposable income. However, the housing is a dual good: it can be used both for consumption (as a place to live) and for investment (as a store of value and possibility to make money). Hence, the demand for housing has the following determinants: demography (population, number of households, migration); disposable income; the opportunity cost (interest rate); and the price.</p>
<div id="demography" class="section level3" number="3.4.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.4.1</span> Demography</h3>
<p>The population growth leads to a rising need for housing. However, when population is constant or even declining, the demand for housing can still increase due to the growing number of households, because their size reduces. During 20th and 21st centuries, in European countries, including Russia, household sizes have been declining. Consider, for example, the population and households development in two countries with shrinking population: Germany and Russia in 2002–2010. In Germany, the population decreased by 1,0%, whereas number of households increased by 4,1%. In Russia, between 2002 and 2010, the average household size dropped from 2.7 to 2.6 persons, which led an increase of the number of private households from 52.7 to 54.6 million, that is, by 3.5%.<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> At the same, the number of the private household members declined from 142.8 to 141.0 million, i.e., by 1.3%. During the same period, in the Russian urban areas, the number of the private households increased by 5.1%, with their population remaining almost unchanged, while the average household size decreased from 2.7 to 2.5.</p>
<p>In many countries, the natural population growth is negative. It means that the number of deaths exceeds the number of births. In this case, the population growth can be achieved only through immigration. Figure <a href="ch-Market.html#fig:NetMigrationRussia">3.3</a> shows the net migration (immigration minus emigration) in Russia between 1991 and 2018.</p>

</div>
<p>As seen, the net migration in Russia has been positive, sometimes —in the early 1990s— exceeding 800,000 persons. This inflow of foreign population in part offset the decline of population in the Russian Federation.</p>
<p>Similarly, the migration has played an important role in the population growth of Germany in 1950–2019, as Figure <a href="ch-Market.html#fig:NetMigrationGermany">3.4</a> shows.</p>

<p>The net migration to Germany underwent strong fluctuations in the post-WWII period. Two largest and the most recent surges in the net migration are related to the immigration from the former Soviet Union in the early 1990s and the refugee crisis of 2015.</p>

<div id="income" class="section level3" number="3.4.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.4.2</span> Income</h3>
<p>The rise of the purchasing power is related to the increase of the real disposable income. Even if the number of private households remains unchanged, the increase in their welfare leads to the growing demand for housing. This means that the demand for more spacious and comfortable housing increases or people start demanding additional dwellings. For example, in Spain the so-called secondary dwellings () are widespread, which are typically purchased in the recreational areas as a supplement to the principal dwelling located in the area of the permanent residence of the owner.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="sec:Supply" class="section level2" number="3.5">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.5</span> Housing supply</h2>
<p>The supply of housing depends in the first place on its rate of return. Usually, the rate of return of housing is measured by the ratio of the net revenue from letting it out (rental revenue minus related expenses) to the amount of capital invested in purchasing it. The investors compare the expected rate of return of housing to the alternative forms of investment, which have the same or smaller risk. When the risk-weighted rate of return of investment in the housing market is equal to the risk-weighted rate of return of other assets, the investors are indifferent where to invest their capital. Typically, the rate of interest on bank deposits is considered as an alternative rate of return. If the interest rate increases, then, other things being equal, the willingness of investors to invest their capital in the housing market will diminish. Similar things happen when the expected rate of return on housing declines. This can be a result of a reduction of the housing price, cost increases, and rise of risk. The housing price decrease can be caused by the reduction of demand or by the saturation of the market. The costs can change as a result of the use of the new technologies (e.g., cheaper pre-engineered buildings), increasing energy saving standards (for example, the houses must have double or triple plastic windows and a special weatherization of walls), improvement of comfort (for instance, the availability of elevators or special equipment for elderly and disabled people), or shortage of the building materials and labor force (as result of construction growth or of its use for other, e.g., military purposes). The government can affect the building costs, for it is the government that introduces the norms of housing consumption, equipment, and energy saving, as well as changes the rate of return of the housing market.</p>
<p>During the peacetime, the housing stock changes rather slowly. For example, in Russia, the stock of housing is large: in 2017, there were 65.9 million dwellings or 3.7 billion square meters. In comparison to the housing stock, the net increase of housing is small: between 2001 and 2017, the average annual increase of the Russian housing stock had been 1% in terms of the number of dwellings and by 1.6% in terms of the area.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="ch-Market.html#fig:HousingConstructionSelectedCountries">3.5</a> depicts the housing construction dynamics in several countries. The housing construction is measured by the number of completed dwellings (flats in the apartment buildings and single-family houses).</p>
<div class="figure"><span id="fig:HousingConstructionSelectedCountries"></span>

<p class="caption">
Figure 3.5: Completed dwellings, 1950–2019
</p>
</div>
<p>As seen, the residential construction has underwent strong fluctuations. On the one hand, they are related to the large-scale post-war reconstruction programs, especially in Germany and Russia. On the other hand, they result from cyclicity of the housing market. A big construction boom, which preceded the Great Recession 2008–2009 is very pronounced. This in particular true in case of Spain, where in the first half of the 2000s, 3–4 times more housing had been built than in Germany, despite the fact the population of Germany is double of that of Spain. This conditioned a very destructive contraction that followed. In Russia, the residential construction declined during the "lost decade’’ of the 1990s, when as a result of the breakdown of the Soviet Union and badly designed policy of transition toward market economy, the nation incurred enormous material losses.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="ch-Market.html#fig:HousingConstructionWorldwide">3.6</a> displays the average annual residential construction intensity between 1900 and 2017. In fact, it covers an unbalanced panel of 62 countries.</p>

<p>It compares the housing construction worldwide, in the former Socialist countries, and in Russia. As seen, the residential construction rapidly fell during both world wars and then strongly increased. The highest construction intensity had been observed between 1950 and 1990. During this period, Socialist countries demonstrated particularly high intensity of residential construction. Between 1990 and 2000, a large drop in the construction can be observed, which especially hard hit the former Socialist countries that engaged during that period on the way of transition. Another substantial decrease in the construction intensity took place in the wake of the Great Recession of 2008–2009. Interestingly, since 2010, Russia demonstrates a higher than the worldwide average intensity of residential construction, which, however, falls short of the level attained in the last years of the USSR, let alone the record levels attained in the late 1950s.</p>

<div id="sec:Prices" class="section level2" number="3.6">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.6</span> Housing prices</h2>
<p>The housing price allows establishing an equilibrium between the supply of and demand for housing. It performs a signalling function by informing the builders, landlords, and consumers about housing shortage or excess supply.</p>

</div>
<p>All these housing price indices are set to 100% in 2015. A logarithmic scale is used in order to better see the relative increases of the prices. Germany demonstrates the lowest growth rates of housing prices over most part of the period. Russia experienced in the 1990s a very swift increase in the housing prices, which is related to the liberalization of its economy, privatization of the housing stock, and the hyperinflation. After 70 years of the centrally planned economy, where housing market was confined to a very narrow niche, virtually all residential properties became an object of buying and selling. Spain and the UK also had rapid house price increases, while the USA occupied an intermediate position. Around 2008, the upward trend was broken and in all countries, except for Germany, the prices fell down. After several years of stagnation, they started to recover.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="ch-Market.html#fig:HousePricesSelectedOECDCountries">3.7</a> displays the nominal prices. Therefore, in part their increases can be explained by the overall inflation rates in each country. For instance, in Russia, the housing price increase in the 1990s is to a large extent due to its tremendous hyperinflation. Figure <a href="ch-Market.html#fig:RealHousePricesSelectedOECDCountries">3.8</a> accounts for this by presenting the real housing prices, that is, the nominal prices divided by the consumer price index and, thus, corrected for inflation.</p>

<p>The adjustment for inflation rates makes the house price cycles more visible. They take various lengths, varying from five to ten years and sometimes synchronized between countries. The adjustment of housing prices for the overall price level growth makes also pronounced a house price decline in Germany that lasted from the mid-1990s through 2010 and the current crisis of the Russian housing market, where real prices have fallen since 2014.</p>
<p>The house price data presented above cover almost 50 years, in case of Russia — about 20 years. A very long-term evolution of real house prices in 14 advanced countries can be traced thanks to a database compiled by <span class="citation">Knoll, Schularick, and Steger (<a href="#ref-Knoll_et_al_2017" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span>; see Figure <a href="ch-Market.html#fig:HousePricesLongRun">3.9</a>.

<p>Between 1870 and 1950s, the real house prices stagnated. It is only since the 1950s, that they began to rapidly increase. The price of land plays a central role for the long-term evolution of house prices. Construction costs rose in the interwar period, increased substantially in 1950–1970, and then leveled off.</p>

<div id="sec:Equilibrium" class="section level2" number="3.7">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.7</span> Housing market equilibrium</h2>
<p>The establishment of the housing market equilibrium can be illustrated using Figure <a href="ch-Market.html#fig:HousingMarketEquilibrium">3.10</a>, which depicts the standard stock and flow model. The left panel shows the housing stock, while the right panel display the net change (flow) of the housing stock. Along the horizontal axis, the area of housing in square meters is plotted, whereas the vertical axis shows the rent per square meter. In the short run, the housing supply is determined by the available housing stock and is, therefore, completely inelastic. For this reason, the supply curves in the left panel are depicted as vertical straight lines.</p>
<div class="figure"><span id="fig:HousingMarketEquilibrium"></span>
<img src="03-Market_files/figure-html/HousingMarketEquilibrium-1.png" alt="The stock-flow model" width="672" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 3.10: The stock-flow model
</p>
</div>
<p>In the right panel, the supply curve <span class="math inline">\(S_{\Delta H}\)</span> has a positive slope and denotes a net inflow of the housing into the market, <span class="math inline">\(\Delta H\)</span>. When the housing rent, <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>, is high, then the net inflow is positive. However, if the rent is low, then the net flow can be negative. This is related to the fact that the housing can not only appear on the market, but also disappear from it as a result of demolition, merger of several dwellings into one, etc. The net inflow of housing, <span class="math inline">\(\Delta H\)</span>, represents a difference between the newly built and eliminated housing. When the rent <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> is high, much new housing is built and little old housing is demolished. However, when the housing rent is low, the rental revenues of the landlords decrease, which makes the construction of new housing less attractive and can induce the housing owners to neglect maintenance and even demolish the existing housing. In this case, the net inflow of housing becomes negative. When the housing rent equals <span class="math inline">\(r_e\)</span>, in the point, where curve <span class="math inline">\(S_{\Delta H}\)</span> intersects the vertical axis, the area of the newly built dwellings is equal to that of the eliminated dwellings; thus, the net inflow is zero leaving the housing stock unchanged.</p>
<p>Initially, the housing stock equals <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>. The demand for housing is represented by the curve <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> having negative slope. In the point of intersection of both lines, the housing rent is <span class="math inline">\(r_0\)</span>. At such rental price, the investors (developers) are ready to build <span class="math inline">\(\Delta H_1\)</span> square meters of housing. Therefore, in the next period, the supply curve will shift rightward, into the position <span class="math inline">\(H_1=H_0+\Delta H_1\)</span> and the rent decreased to <span class="math inline">\(r_1\)</span>. However, event in that case, the developers are still willing to erect additional housing, albeit less than in the previous period — <span class="math inline">\(\Delta H_2\)</span>. Thus, the new residential construction will continue until the housing stock will increase up to <span class="math inline">\(H_e\)</span> and the rental price will fall to <span class="math inline">\(r_e\)</span>. This will be an equilibrium level. The housing market will remain in the equilibrium until it will be distorted by some supply or demand shock.</p>
<p>What kind of shocks can force the housing market out of its equilibrium? For example, an earthquake can destroy a part of the housing stock and, thus, cause a negative supply shock. In such a case, the long-run supply curve in the left panel will immediately shift leftward. This will lead to a rent increase, which will induce a new housing construction and, hence, gradual expansion of the housing stock. Migration can also affect the equilibrium. In case of negative net migration (emigration), the demand for housing decreases and the demand curve shifts leftward leading to a reduction of rent. By contrast, positive net migration (immigration) will lead to a rightward shift of demand curve causing rents to rise, which, in turn, will stimulate the developers to expand the new housing construction and slow down the removal of the existing housing units.</p>
<p>What happens if the housing price changes? Suppose that the price increases. This increases the attractiveness of supplying more housing and can lead to the new construction; a slowdown of wearing through current repairs; and housing modernization implying a change of layout and a quality improvement of the existing housing. If the price decreases, then there is less or no new construction; the (rental) dwellings are converted to other (non-residential) uses; and more buildings are demolished.</p>
