# Housing valuation {#ch:Valuation}


## Introduction

This chapter is devoted to the assessment of the real estate. Section \@ref(sec:Valuation) explains, why we need to assess the value of properties. In section <!-- \ref{sec:Hedonic}, the hedonic approach to the valuation of the real estate is introduced. Section \ref{sec:Repeated} discusses an alternative valuation method, which is known as the repeated-measures index. In this section, we will talk about the standard approach and about the weighted, or the Case-Shiller approach. In section \ref{sec:Spatial}, we describe the spatial econometric tools that can be useful for analyzing the property value, given its immovable nature and importance of locational characterstics. -->

## Real estate valuation {#sec:Valuation}

### Motivation
Why valuation of the real estates is needed? There are several reasons why people should bother assessing the value of the property, which are thoroughly discussed below.
	
First, it is important to evaluate the just compensation in compulsory acquisition. Even in the free market economies, the authorities sometimes confiscate the property of the citizens. This can be related, for example, to the construction of a new road or a hydroelectric plant. Typically, the owners receive compensation for the real estate they lose. However, is this compensation fair? Or is the price offered by the authorities far below what your property is worth?

Second, the knowledge about the property value is necessary for the fair taxation. In most countries, the owners of the real estate pay property taxes on the annual basis. In Russia, for instance, the value of each property is registered in the cadastre. The authorities using certain methodology and information about characteristics of the real estate estimate its taxable value. Is this value fair or is it set to high, since it does not take into account some important factors reducing the true value of the property?

Third, the information about the value of the real estate is needed for the market transactions. For example, you want to buy or sell a dwelling. In that case, you have to know its fair market price. If you buy the dwelling, you do not want to pay a price that is too high. In case you sell it, you have to be sure that the price you are paid is not too low.

Fourth, property can be bought using borrowed money or used as security in order to obtain a mortgage loan. Both the bank lending money and the borrower need to know the fair value of the property. What happens, if the assessment was wrong? In case of bank, this can lead to the impossibility to recover the lent money, if the borrower defaults. In case of the borrower, the failure to assess the real estate correctly can lead to a lower amount of loan.
