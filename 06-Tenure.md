# Housing tenure {#ch:Tenure}


## Introduction

In this chapter, we will introduce the notion of housing tenure and will present several tenure types and forms. Then, in section \@ref(sec:ImportanceHOR), we will concentrate on the homeownership and discuss its importance, advantages and disadvantages. In section \@ref(sec:Choice), a formal model will be formulated, which tries to explain why and how many people choose to become homeowners and other --- tenants. Finally, in section \@ref(sec:Variation), we will show the spatio-temporal variation of the homeownership rate across the world.

## Types of tenure {#sec:Tenure}

The housing tenure is defined as institutional forms by which possession of housing is accommodated with ownership of housing. Possession is the entitlement to hold a resource, for a term or indefinitely, as well as to control it and benefit from its use. The ownership includes possession and a right to transfer all or some of the rights over resource (holding, controlling, and benefiting from its use). 

The national systems of housing tenure are very different. For example, a study conducted in nine European countries distinguished 42 kinds of tenures [@Sisksio_1990].

In modern societies, there are two major institutions through which possession of housing is accommodated with rights of ownership: 1) the ownership implies that consumer has ownership rights over his dwelling and, thus, the right of possession and of disposal; and the renting, or leasing means that consumer acquires the right of possession by renting the dwelling from the owner. A subform of letting is the subletting, when the tenant rents out a part of the dwelling he himself occupies. The crucial difference between the ownership and letting lies in the right of disposal.

Sometimes, apart from these two major types, a third tenure type is identified. It is known as *excluded tenures*, when the households have no ownership or legal tenancy over housing. These include homelessness; temporary accommodation; squatting; as well as illegally built housing and unauthorized encampments.

Some authors further subdivide the tenure types into subtypes. For example, @Ruonavaara_1993 suggests the following classification of tenure subtypes.
*Ownership* has three subtypes: 1) individual owner-occupation --- individual households hold exclusive rights of ownership on the housing unit; 2) shared-equity owner-occupation --- equity is split in to two distinct parts: one owned individually and the other owned collectively (e.g. condominium or cooperative); and 3) collective owner-occupation --- several households form a community holding collectively the rights of ownership so that no single household holds individual ownership rights over the dwellings (e.g., cooperative). *Renting* can be subdivided into two subtypes: 1) private renting --- dwellings are owned by private firms and individuals; and 2) public or social renting --- dwellings are owned by public organizations (local authorities) or non-profit landlord organizations (e.g., trade unions).

The **condominium property**, that is, the right to own an individual apartment in an multi-family apartment house is a relatively recent phenomenon. In most countries, it was introduced in the 1950--1960s, while in the former Socialist countries, it emerged in the early 1990s; Figure \@ref(fig:Condominium). The height of each bar shows the number of countries that issued their condominium acts in the respective decade. A two-digit ISO-alpha 2 code denotes country and the number after it is the year of publication of the act. The introduction of the condominium property paved the way for the expansion of the homeownership rates in the urban areas, where apartment buildings account for a large part of the housing stock.

Figure \@ref(fig:HousingOwnershipStructureDE) depicts the housing ownership structure in Germany in 2011. About 60\% of housing units belong to the private persons, these are single-family and semi-terraced houses, which are mostly located in the country side and in the periphery of the cities. The dwellings in the condominium property make up somewhat over 20\% of the housing stock. The remaining 30\% are more or less evenly distributed between the dwellings in the ownership of local authorities, private firms managing large stocks of housing, and cooperatives.

## The importance of homeownership {#sec:ImportanceHOR}

The homeownership plays an important role in the wealth accumulation --- more than half of the private households' wealth is the real estate. Worldwide, over 60\% of all private households are the owners of the dwellings where they live. 

Many governments strive to maximize the homeownership. They encourage mortgage finance and offer financial incentives for people to buy private housing. For example, in the UK, the government helps tenants to buy dwellings they rent by offering 50\% subsidy on market price. In the USA, where being a homeowner is a part of the American Dream, the authorities spend each year about \$195 billion (this corresponds to approximately 1\% of GDP) in tax deductions for mortgage interest for wealthy and middle class homeowners and only \$46 billion a year on affordable housing, which supports affordable housing investments for low-income Americans [@Collinson_et_al_2015]. Thus, the lion's share of government support is directed toward wealthier layers of society.

Why do the governments decide to spend so much money on stimulating the homeownership? The motivation of governments evolved over time and can be different across countries. Here, we summarize the main motives making the government stimulate the expansion of the class of the homeowners.
		
*Support of families*. Families with children are more likely to become homeowners, especially of the single-family houses. Their motivation is often to raise their children in green, where they will have more opportunities to play outside in a nice and healthier environment. Inversely, it has been long thought that owning such a dwelling will stimulate people to have larger families.

*The opposition to left-wing political trends*. After World War II, many countries chose the socialist way of development. In Europe, the capitalist and socialist countries co-existed next to each other. Initially, the idea of socialism seemed to be very attractive. Therefore, the governments of the countries with market economy tried to gain more loyalty from their citizens. They thought that the owners, in particular, those possessing the real estate, would be more resistant against the charms of socialism and left-wing movements disseminating the socialist ideas.

*The old-age care*. Owning the housing is regarded as a good hedge against inflation. Therefore, it is thought to be a supplement to the pension or even substitute, when no pension is provided. After retirement, older people can, for example, sell their dwelling, buy another smaller one, which is worth less, and consume the difference between the value of their previous and new dwellings. Alternatively, they can also borrow money against the value of their dwelling. Some retired persons opt also for the life-time pension paid by a bank or some other organization against the promise that it will inherit the dwelling after these persons' death. Yet another expectation is to save money in the old age, because there will be no need to pay the rent. This motivation becomes especially important at the background of the aging population, a phenomenon observed in many European countries, including Russia. However, such expectations can be disappointed. First, the relative price of an existing owner-occupied dwelling may fall, if the demand for it decreases due to improvements in the design of the new dwellings. Second, flats located in large apartment buildings ---where the ratio of total surface to the area of the land plot occupied by the building is very big--- can depreciate even more. The reason is that the supply of land is inelastic, while that of building materials and labor is not. Therefore, the properties endowed with land, which is a non-depreciable input, may on average appreciate in real value over time [@Ching_Tyabji_1991].

The homeownership is a complex phenomenon, having its advantages and disadvantages, which are discussed below.

*Homeownership and speculative bubbles*. The homeownership is associated with speculative bubbles.^[More on speculative asset price bubbles see in Chapter \@ref(ch:Bubbles).] For example, after World War II, the expansion of mortgage credit related to the growth of the homeownership became a driver of financial instability in advanced economies [@Jorda_et_al_2016]. High-homeownership countries are more prone to volatile house prices and credit cycles [@Ruenstler_2016]. Moreover, the policies promoting homeownership also stimulate speculative bubbles [@Catte_et_al_2004].
		
*Homeownership and mobility*. Homeownership can reduce the residential mobility, since it is associated to higher transaction costs than the renting [@Stein_1995;@Cameron_Muellbauer_1998;@Glaeser_Shapiro_2003;@Blanchflower_Oswald_2013]. According to the hypothesis, known as the **Oswald conjecture**, the homeownership is positively correlated with the unemployment [@Oswald_1996_conjecture]. If the unemployment rate in certain region increases, people could move to other regions with lower unemployment. However, the homeowners are less likely to move due to the transaction costs. Therefore, they stay in their region. This has a negative impact on the efficiency of the labor market. This hypothesis has been tested in many studies. The findings of @Lerbs_2011 for German regions and those of @Blanchflower_Oswald_2013 for the US states support the Oswald hypothesis. Several studies found mixed evidence [@Oliver_Oberst_2014]. By contrast, @Huber_et_al_2017, who investigate the relation between the homeownership and unemployment as well as mobility in 10 CEE countries (including three former USSR republics), find no evidence that homeownership has detrimental impact on individuals' unemployment risks and only weak evidence that homeownership limits mobility.

*Homeownership and individual effects*. The homeownership is found to produce beneficial individual effects [@Megbolugbe_Linneman_1993]. According to this research, the homeowners tend to have higher life satisfaction; neighborhood stability; better children's performance at school; and less divorces. The children of homeowners are more likely to complete their secondary education (less dropouts) and are less likely to become pregnant as teenagers than the children of tenants [@Green_White_1997]. Homeowners tend to save more than tenants, even when their investment in purchasing their home are controlled for [@Krumm_Kelly_1989].

*Homeownership and civil society*. The homeowners are found to participate more actively in the social activities related to their neighborhoods [@Glaeser_Shapiro_2003]. For example, homeowners are more likely to be involved in joining non-professional organizations, gardening, and in investing in social capital in comparison to renters [@DiPasqule_Glaeser_1999]. In the USA, renter communities have significantly worse civic environments than homeowner ones [@Hoff_Sen_2005]. By contrast, @Kortelainen_Saarimaa_2015 using a hedonic house price model where neighborhood homeownership rate is included as an explanatory variable find no evidence of positive externalities from neighborhood homeownership rate. Homeowners are found to invest more in the maintenance of their houses [@Galster_1983;@Rohe_Stewart_1996].
 
The literature also points out other possibly detrimental effects of the high homeownership. @Lo_2012 using Taiwan data finds out that higher homeownership leads to lower fertility rates. The homeownership can exert adverse effects on the propensity to the enterpreneurship. As shown in @Bracke_et_al_2012, purchasing house reduces the probability of starting business by 20--25\%. This result is driven by households with mortgages and persists for several years after entering in the homeownership. 

Summing up, the homeownership has many merits, although the corresponding findings of the empirical research are not always unambiguous. It also has serious drawbacks. Nevertheless, it is not clear whether the net effects of the homeownership are positive or negative.

## Tenure choice {#sec:Choice}

### User cost
The tenure choice refers to the decision the household makes whether to become a homeowner or tenant (or renter). This choice depends on the **user costs of housing**. The user costs of housing vary depending on the type of tenure. The tenant's (renter's) costs is the rental price he pays to the landlord. Typically, the homeowner has the following costs and benefits: 1) mortgage payment; 2) property taxes; 3) depreciation on the dwelling; and 4) housing capital gains.

Let us consider a simple model of tenant choice. This model is based on a set of simplifying assumptions which refer to each of the costs and benefits. 

*The mortgage payment*. Assume that the consumer buys the house using a 100\% mortgage without no down payment. Assume also that this is an interest-only mortgage, i.e., the buyer does not pay the principal amount, only interest accrued on the mortgage debt. Let us denote the mortgage interest cost $iV$, where $i$ is the mortgage interest rate and $V$ is the value of the house.

*Property taxes*. The owner of a house must pay property taxes. The two most widespread taxes are the *stamp duty*, which is paid only once, at the moment of purchasing the house, and the *land tax*, which is paid every year. Here, when talking about property tax we will always refer to the land tax, unless the opposite is not indicated. The property tax is defined as $hV$, where $h$ is the property tax rate. 

*Depreciation on the dwelling*. The depreciation denotes the annual decline in the value of the house as it wears out. It is denoted as $dV$, where $d$ is the depreciation rate. The depreciation rate is typically 1--2\% per year.

*Housing capital gains*. The only financial benefit related to the housing is its capital gains, which reflect the general appreciation of housing values. It can be either positive, if the price of the dwelling increases, or negative, when it decreases. The housing capital gains are denoted as $gV$, where $g$ is the rate of capital gains (annual percentage change in house value).

Now, we can formally express the annual costs incurred by homeowner:
\begin{equation}
			(i+h+d-g)V = (i+h+d-g)vq
\end{equation}
where $q$ is the amount of housing consumption (e.g., total area in $m^2$). Note that the costs of maintenance and insurance are omitted.

Then, the annual homeowner's costs per unit of housing consumption are:
\begin{equation}
			(i+h+d-g)v
\end{equation}
