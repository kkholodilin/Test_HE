<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.1</span> Introduction</h2>
<p>This chapter is devoted to such an important economic phenomenon as the speculative price bubbles. In section <a href="ch-Bubbles.html#sec:Bubbles">5.2</a>, we will define the speculative bubbles and discuss their importance for the society. In section <a href="ch-Bubbles.html#sec:EWS">5.3</a>, a typology of the early warning systems is presented. In section <a href="ch-Bubbles.html#sec:Dating">5.4</a>, the techniques, which allow dating the periods of expansions (bubbles) and recessions (no bubbles) are presented. <!-- Sections \ref{sec:EWS_exogenous} and \ref{sec:EWS_endogenous} show the ways how to timely recognize signs of the building-up speculative bubbles using the early warning systems with exogenous and endogenous bubble chronologies, correspondingly. --></p>
</div>
<div id="sec:Bubbles" class="section level2" number="5.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.2</span> Speculative bubbles</h2>
<p>The trajectory of the market economy is not smooth. From time to time, the economy experiences booms and crises. The examples of large crises include the Great Depression 1929–1932 that took place worldwide and to some extent was responsible for the outbreak of World War II; the Lost Decade (1991–2000 or even 1991–2010) in Japan; as well as the Great Recession, or Financial Crisis, 2008–2009 and the COVID-19 sanitary and economic crisis of 2019 that shook virtually entire world.</p>
<p>In many cases, the economic crises are triggered by the speculations. The speculation can be defined as purchasing an asset not for own use but with an expectation that its price will increase further and that the asset can be sold at a later stage in order to realize capital gains. Speculations arise because financial capital is looking for ways of earning profit. It cannot lie idle, so the capital holders are always screening various markets in order to find those having the highest profit margin. So, speculations can emerge in virtually any market. From the early economic history, we know examples of speculating with tulip bulbs —the so-called "tulip mania’’— in The Netherlands in the 1630s. Speculations with stocks are also known at least from the early 18th century, such as the Mississippi Bubble 1718–1720 and the South Sea bubble of 1719–1720. See, for example, <span class="citation">Garber (<a href="#ref-Garber_1990" role="doc-biblioref">1990</a>)</span>. In 2001, a large crisis occured at the stock market, which was related to the speculations with stocks of the nascent Internet companies and, therefore, was nicknamed the DotCom crisis. The housing also often becomes an object for speculations. For example, the Great Recession 2008–2009 was mainly triggered by the speculations with subprime mortgage loans in the USA.</p>
<p>The <strong>speculative asset price bubble</strong> is defined as "large, sustained mispricings of financial or real assets’’ . Alternatively, the speculative bubbles refer to the periods in which the price of an asset exceeds its fundamental value due to investors’ beliefs that they can sell the asset at a
higher price in the future. The fundamental value of an asset is its value determined by its dividend stream. By contrast, the speculative component of the asset’s value is that based on the expectations of reselling it at a higher price.</p>
<p>How do the economists explain the emergence of speculative price bubbles? There are several well-established theories that explain seemingly unsustainable developments by rational behavior of agents <span class="citation">(Brunnermeier <a href="#ref-Brunnermeier_2008" role="doc-biblioref">2008</a>; Brunnermeier and Oehmke <a href="#ref-Brunnermeier_Oehmke_2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>; Glaeser and Nathanson <a href="#ref-Glaeser_Nathanson_2015" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span>. <span class="citation">Brunnermeier and Oehmke (<a href="#ref-Brunnermeier_Oehmke_2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span> provide a classification of the existing approaches to explaining the buildup of asset price bubbles. They distinguish between five types of theories.</p>
<p>The first explanation is the rational bubbles theory. It is argued that investors hold bubble assets since they expect the price of the asset to grow under the assumption that any investor in the future also expects asset price increases, even if the bubble may burst with a certain probability. Price increases then become self-fulfilling prophecies, which implies explosive growth of asset valuations <span class="citation">(Blanchard and Watson <a href="#ref-Blanchard_Watson_1982" role="doc-biblioref">1982</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Second, overlapping generations models allow the existence of bubbles, because they can restore efficiency of an economy, which is inherently not Pareto optimal <span class="citation">(Tirole <a href="#ref-Tirole_1985" role="doc-biblioref">1985</a>)</span>. The idea is that even fiat money —which has no intrinsic value— can have a positive price because it is a store of value. Storing value, and thus increasing the price of money, might be a rational option in situations of over-accumulation of private capital, i.e., when capital accumulation exceeds the "golden rule.’’ Then, transferring capital to future generations and giving fiat money a positive price (which is then a bubble asset) can increase economic efficiency.</p>
<p>Third, the persistence of bubbles can be explained in the framework of the informational frictions theory. In this type of model, two sources of risk are introduced that encourage traders to invest in bubble assets. On the one hand, the fundamental risk arises from uncertainty of an unexpected jump of the fundamental value. In this case, investors who bet against a bubble lose money. On the other hand, risk-neutral traders, who are aware of the bubble, can still trade in order to benefit from speculative price increases, as long as they weigh the risk of a bursting bubble less than the chances of price increases <span class="citation">(Abreu and Brunnermeier <a href="#ref-Abreu_Brunnermeier_2003" role="doc-biblioref">2003</a>)</span>. In both cases, investors delay the bursting of the bubble and allow it to grow even larger.</p>
<p>Fourth, according to the delegated investment theory, most households delegate the management of their assets to the fund managers, who often are concerned only about short-run price movements <span class="citation">(Shleifer and Vishny <a href="#ref-Shleifer_Vishny_1997" role="doc-biblioref">1997</a>)</span> and may have incentives to buy overpriced assets <span class="citation">(Allen and Gorton <a href="#ref-Allen_Gorton_1993" role="doc-biblioref">1993</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Fifth, the theory of the heterogeneous-beliefs bubbles implies that investors, possibly due to psychological biases, have different beliefs about the future. These beliefs when combined-with short-sale constraints-can lead to overpricing when optimists push up prices, while pessimists are unable to counteract this <span class="citation">(Miller <a href="#ref-Miller_1977" role="doc-biblioref">1977</a>)</span>. Regardless of the driving forces behind a bubble, house price bubbles can be defined as periods in which housing prices run well above their fundamental values, i.e., the development of rents. In addition, as pointed out by <span class="citation">Brunnermeier and Oehmke (<a href="#ref-Brunnermeier_Oehmke_2013" role="doc-biblioref">2013</a>)</span>, asset values grow explosively during speculative bubble periods. While the notion ``well above’’ is rather open to interpretation, an explosive house price growth can be formally tested using statistical methods.</p>
<p>An important role in the formation of speculative asset price bubbles is played by the <em>financialization</em>. The financialization can be defined as a way of capital accumulation, when profit-making takes place increasingly through financial channels rather than through trade and production <span class="citation">(Aalbers <a href="#ref-Aalbers_2016" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span>. Due to the slowdown of economic growth, the capital accumulation becomes more and more focused on the growth of finance, benefiting the financial markets agents (investors) rather than the real economy. The financialization embraces increasingly the non-financial firms (Internet, car industry, real estate sector, etc.) and households forcing them to accept risks and act as capitalists. It became a means of the <em>capital switching</em> in the sense of <span class="citation">Harvey (<a href="#ref-Harvey_1985" role="doc-biblioref">1985</a>)</span>, which channels the capital from the primary circuit (production, manufacturing, industrial sector), secondary (built environment for production, e.g., infrastructure, and for consumption, e.g., housing), or tertiary circuit (social infrastructure, i.e., investment in technology, science, conditions of employees, health and education) to the quaternary circuit of capital <span class="citation">(Aalbers <a href="#ref-Aalbers_2016" role="doc-biblioref">2016</a>)</span>. This capital switching inevitably leads to over-accumulation and to crises.</p>
<p>The crises are costly — they destroy jobs and wealth. The bursting bubbles and resulting crises lead to huge GDP losses, increases in unemployment, bankruptcies of firms and private households, and other negative consequences for the whole society or its important parts. Therefore, it is important to be able to foresee them. If we will be able to identify timely the arrival of crises, then we can hope to mitigate their negative consequences.</p>

<div id="sec:EWS" class="section level2" number="5.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.3</span> Early warning system</h2>
<p><strong>An early warning system</strong> is a tool for forecasting the booms and crises. It has two main elements: 1) an expansion/recession (boom/bust) dates, or bubble chronology; and a forecasting model. In the first step, the periods of bubbles and no bubbles, or expansions and recessions are established. In the second, step a forecasting model is estimated, which allows predicting the bubbles. Figure <a href="ch-Bubbles.html#fig:EWSScheme">5.1</a> depicts a typology of different early warning systems.</p>
<div class="figure"><span id="fig:EWSScheme"></span>
<img src="05-Bubbles_files/figure-html/EWSScheme-1.png" alt="Early warning system" width="672" />
<p class="caption">
Figure 5.1: Early warning system
</p>
</div>
<p>It distinguishes between the early warning systems with exogenous and endogenous chronologies. In the EWS with exogenous chronology, the determination of the bubble chronology step is done separately and independently on the forecasting step, while in the EWS with endogenous endogenous both these steps are carried out simultaneously. Figure <a href="ch-Bubbles.html#fig:EWSScheme">5.1</a> displays three families of methods used in order to establish the bubble chronology (<em>ad hoc</em> approach, expert judgment, and statistical testing), two families of forecasting techniques requiring exogenous chronologies (signalling approach and discrete-choice models), and three forecasting methods with endogenous chronology (TAR, STAR, and Markov switching). Below we will discuss each of these methods in more detail.</p>
</div>
<div id="sec:Dating" class="section level2" number="5.4">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.4</span> Dating the speculative bubbles</h2>
<p>Nobody knows when exactly do the speculative bubbles (or expansions and recessions in case of business cycles) start and end. In fact, what we observe are periodic declines and increases of asset prices or economic performance. However, without special techniques it is impossible to tell apart small short-lived fluctuations from the cyclical movements. Therefore, some algorithm is needed in order to establish the chronology of bubbles or business cycles. As shown in Figure , there are three families of methods establishing bubble chronologies: 1) expert judgment; 2) <em>ad hoc</em> dating; and 3) formal statistical tests.</p>
<div id="expert-judgment" class="section level3" number="5.4.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.4.1</span> Expert judgment</h3>
<p>A group of experts decides on the dates of beginning and ending of booms and busts. The most known such a group is the <strong>NBER’s Business Cycle Dating Committee</strong>.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a>
It maintains a chronology of the U.S. business cycle. The chronology comprises alternating dates of peaks and troughs in economic activity. The way the experts make their dating decisions is perfectly described by the NBER itself:</p>
<p><em>The Committee applies its judgment… and has no fixed rule to determine whether a contraction is only a short interruption of an expansion, or an expansion is only a short interruption of a contraction.</em></p>
<p>The NBER does not have a fixed definition of economic activity. It examines and compares the behavior of various measures of broad activity: <em>real GDP</em>, economy-wide <em>employment</em>, and <em>real income</em>. The NBER also can consider indicators that do not cover the entire economy, such as <em>real sales</em> and the Fed’s index of <em>industrial production</em>. A well-defined peak or trough in real sales or industrial production helps to determine overall peak or trough dates, particularly if the economy-wide indicators are in conflict or do not have well-defined peaks or troughs.</p>
<p>Figure <a href="ch-Bubbles.html#fig:NBERChronology">5.2</a> plots the US real GDP together with the NBER business cycle chronology depicted as shaded areas.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>Sources: FRED, NBER, and own representation.</p>
<p>It can be seen that the NBER chronology accurately picks up the declines in the real GDP. An especially deep and protracted decline is observed in 2008–2009, the episode known as the Great Recession.</p>
<p>The NBER is an established authority and its chronology is a widely recognized one. Other countries have no such expert committee at the national level. Fortunately, there is an international organization — <strong>Economic Cycle Research Institute (ECRI)</strong>, which produces business cycle chronologies for various countries.<a href="#fn13" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<p>Each technique has its advantages and disadvantages. What are the strengths and weaknesses of the expert judgment approach? It has the following advantages: Experts make use of different sources of information. The wise judgment can be superior to a thoughtless use of sophisticated techniques. The disadvantages of the expert judgment approach to dating the bubbles are as follows: The expert’s procedure is not transparent. It is impossible to replicate. It is a very time consuming process: it takes many months or even years to identify the cyclical phases.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">5.4.2</span> Ad hoc dating methods</h3>
<p>The simplest method of dating business cycles and speculative asset price bubble is the rule of thumb using the <em>two-quarter definition</em>. According to this rule, recession is defined as two consecutive quarters of decline in real GDP.</p>
<p>A more sophisticated technique is the procedure developed by <span class="citation">Bry and Boschan (<a href="#ref-Bry_Boschan_1971" role="doc-biblioref">1971</a>)</span>. It tries to emulate the decision making process of the NBER using the monthly series of industrial production. The Bry-Boschan technique does not use any formal statistical framework to do the dating. Instead it translates the NBER method into a set of simple decision rules. It basically comprises two stages: 1) selecting the candidates for turning points and 2) applying a censoring rule to eliminate the turning points, which do not satisfy some criteria (e.g., minimum duration).</p>
<p>A quarterly version of Bry-Boschan technique was developed by <span class="citation">Harding and Pagan (<a href="#ref-Harding_Pagan_2001" role="doc-biblioref">2001</a>)</span>. Each point in the sample is checked for being a local maximum or minimum:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{equation}
	y_t=\left\{
	\begin{array}{l}
\mbox{peak, if } y_t=\max\big(y_{t-K}, \ldots, y_{t+L}\big)\\
\mbox{trough, if } y_t=\min\big(y_{t-K}, \ldots, y_{t+L}\big)\\
\mbox{neither peak nor trough, otherwise}
	\end{array}
	\right.
\end{equation}\]</span>
Normally, one takes <span class="math inline">\(K=L=2\)</span> for quarterly data (6 for monthly data). Eliminate candidate peaks and troughs, which do not satisfy two restrictions:
1) minimum phase duration should be 6 months (2 quarters) and 2) complete cycle must last at least 15 months (5 quarters).</p>
<p>The most important appeal of the Bry-Boschan technique is its simplicity and transparency. It is also very robust in the sense that changing the sample will not affect the dates. Although it is sensitive to the choice of criteria and censoring rules. Arbitrariness is the major problem related to the <em>ad hoc</em> techniques.</p>
<p>Crises occurring at the currency markets have their specific features and, therefore, require somewhat different tools in order to identify them. <em>A currency crisis</em> is defined as speculative pressures in foreign exchange markets. In order to identify the periods of a currency crisis, constructed crisis indices need to reflect both successful and unsuccessful speculative attacks on domestic currency. Following <span class="citation">Eichengreen, Rose, and Wyplosz (<a href="#ref-Eichengreen_et_al_1994" role="doc-biblioref">1994</a>)</span> recent studies use as crisis indicator the speculative <em>exchange market pressure (EMP)</em>, which is a weighed average of depreciation rate of nominal exchange rates, percentage change in international reserves, and change in interest rate. Different weighting schemes are possible. For example, it is reasonable to use for this purpose the inverse of the standard deviations of the component variables (<span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{\sigma_i}\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(i=\{\text{exchange rate}, \text{reserves}, \text{interest rate}\}\)</span>) in order to equalize their volatilities.</p>
