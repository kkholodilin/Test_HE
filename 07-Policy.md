# Housing policy {#ch:Policy}


## Introduction

Housing is one of the most important aspects of the human life.^[A detailed account in Russian language on rental housing policies worldwide and, in particular, in Germany, Russia, and the USA can be found in @Kholodilin_2019_ru.] It is also one of the heavily regulated sectors. Since World War I, in most countries, the government actively intervenes in the housing market trying to correct the really existing or imaginary market failures. For example, as seen in Figure <!-- \ref{fig:Map_Existence}, virtually all countries of the world had or still have rent controls. By 2017, the number of countries that still use rent control substantially reduced; Figure \ref{fig:Map_Existence_2017}. Currently, the re-introduction of rent control is discussed in some countries (e.g., Hong Kong,^[@Choi_2017.] Malta, Spain,^[In January 2019, a draft of a Royal decree on housing rents, which provided for a limitation of rent decreases, was rejected by the Parliament of Spain, see https://www.elconfidencial.com/espana/2019-01-22/fomento-decreto-ley-alquiler-podemos-vivienda_1774454/.] and the USA). Thus, not only historically housing market regulations played an important role, they are far from being dead nowadays.
The purpose of the chapter is to make the readers acquainted with a toolkit of policies that has been applied to the housing market in many countries across the world. We carry out a critical analysis of these housing policies. In addition, we discuss the evolution of the restrictive policies (such as rent control, protection of tenants from eviction, and housing rationing) by continents and worldwide between 1910 and 2018. -->
