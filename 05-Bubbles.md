# Speculative asset price bubbles {#ch:Bubbles}


## Introduction

This chapter is devoted to such an important economic phenomenon as the speculative price bubbles. In section \@ref(sec:Bubbles), we will define the speculative bubbles and discuss their importance for the society. In section <!-- \ref{sec:EWS}, a typology of the early warning systems is presented. In section \ref{sec:Dating}, the techniques, which allow dating the periods of expansions (bubbles) and recessions (no bubbles) are presented. Sections \ref{sec:EWS_exogenous} and \ref{sec:EWS_endogenous} show the ways how to timely recognize signs of the building-up speculative bubbles using the early warning systems with exogenous and endogenous bubble chronologies, correspondingly. -->

## Speculative bubbles {#sec:Bubbles}

The trajectory of the market economy is not smooth. From time to time, the economy experiences booms and crises. The examples of large crises include the Great Depression 1929--1932 that took place worldwide and to some extent was responsible for the outbreak of World War II; the Lost Decade (1991--2000 or even 1991--2010) in Japan; and the Great Recession, or Financial Crisis 2008--2009 that shook virtually the entire world.
