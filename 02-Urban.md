# Urban economics {#ch:Urban}


## Introduction

In this chapter, we introduce basic notions of the urban economics. *The urban economics* is a theory about the location choice made by firms and households. It answers the following questions:

* Why do the cities emerge?
* Why do cities differ in terms of size?
* What determines the internal structure of the cities?

The urban theory focuses on the cities, which are an important object of research, given their population and contribution to the world economic growth.

Section \@ref(sec:City) defines the notion of city. In section \@ref(sec:CityOrigins), the origins of cities are explored.  Section \@ref(sec:Urbanization) illustrates the process of growth of the urban population known as urbanization. In Section \@ref(sec:CitiesBig), some explanations are offered, why cities tend to grow and become big. Section \@ref(sec:CitiesDifferent) uses the theory of central places in order to explain why city sizes are so different: from little towns to huge megacities. <!--In section \ref{sec:Internal_structure}, the internal structure of cities and location choices made by firms and households. Section \ref{sec:Gradient}, shows the dependence between location (distance from the city center) and population and employment density. -->


## What is a city? {#sec:City}

The question of what makes a settlement an urban area is not an easy one. Different criteria can be employed in order to define a city. The most typical are the size of population, the population density, and the structure of economic activities carried out in the settlement.

*Population size*. In Russia, a settlement can be declared city, if it has population of 12,000 and more and 85\% of its population are not occupied in agriculture.^[This definition is provided by the Decree of Sep. 12, 1957 *On attributing settlements to the category of cities, worker and resort townships*. Interestingly, its predecessor --- the Decree of September 15, 1924 *General provisions on urban and rural settlements* imposed similar but somewhat lower restrictions: 1000 persons and at least 75\% of population occupied in the non-agricultural production.]Currently, urban settlement status is determined by the legislation of federal subjects.

In many countries, a settlement must have some minimum population in order to be treated as a city. Table \@ref(tab:threshold) reports the minimum required population for several countries.


Table: (\#tab:threshold)Definition of city: country-specific population thresholds

Country                               Citizen
-----------------------------------  --------
Denmark and Sweden                        250
France and Israel                        1000
Mexico and USA                           2000
Azerbaijan and Georgia                   2500
Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Ukraine, etc.       5000
Russia                                  10000
Japan                                   12000

The minimum population varies a lot: from as few as 250 persons in Denmark and Sweden to as many as 30,000 in Japan. In practice, despite the existence of the official minimum threshold, the population of the cities can be well below it. Figure \@ref(fig:boxplotUrbanAreas) and Table \@ref(tab:sizeUrbanAreas) report the descriptive statistics of the distribution of the population of Russian cities and towns (*goroda*) as well as urban villages (*posyolki gorodskogo tipa*) in 2017.

<p class="caption">(\#fig:boxplotUrbanAreas)The size of Russia's urban areas, 2017</p>
</div>

In general, the population in cities and towns is much larger than that of the urban villages. It also mostly exceeds 12,000. However, the lower tail of distribution lies below 1000 persons.

According to Table \@ref(tab:sizeUrbanAreas), there are 1112 cities or towns and 1183 urban villages in Russia.

Maximum, persons        12,380,000 (Moscow)          41,980 (Nakhabino, Moscow reg.) 

The median population of cities or towns is 26,300, which is more than twice as large as the minimum threshold. However, almost one-fourth of all cities and towns are close to or below that lower boundary. The smallest and probably the youngest town Innopolis has slightly more than 100 inhabitants, while the smallest urban village Kozhym has only four residents.

*Population density*. Given the ambiguity of the population size as criterion for defining a city or a town, other indicators are suggested. For example, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) suggested using the population density in order to identify the so-called **functional urban areas** (FUA), which are its proxies for cities [@OECD_2013]. The OECD uses a three-step algorithm in order to delineate the FUAs. In the first step, the urbanized areas, or ``urban high-density clusters'', are defined over the national territory, ignoring administrative borders. For this purpose, the national territory is divided by a continuous grid with a cell size of 1 km$^2$. The urban core then is identified as a high-density cluster of contiguous grid cells of 1 km$^2$ with a density of at least 1,500 inhabitants per km$^2$ (1000 in Canada and USA). In the second step, the non-contiguous cores belonging to the same functional urban area are connected. This is done in order to account for the polycentric cities. Their belonging to the same FUA is determined based on the commuting intensity between cores. If many people are commuting between the neighbor cores, then all these cores are thought to belong to the same FUA. In the third step, the urban hinterlands are identified. These are defined as all  municipalities  with  at  least  15\%  of  their  employed  residents working in a certain urban core.

Figure \@ref(fig:MapFUAGermany) shows an example of the FUAs as determined by the OECD for the case of Germany. Green color denotes the urban cores of the FUAs, while the red areas stand for their hinterlands.

<p class="caption">(\#fig:MapFUAGermany)Functional urban areas of OECD in Germany</p>
</div>

It can be seen that the FUAs go beyond the administrative boundaries of the officially defined cities. For example, the largest FUA in the east of Germany unifies Berlin, Potsdam, and their immediate surroundings. Its hinterland stretches for dozens of kilometers around the core. People living in these areas commute every day to the core, where the jobs are concentrated and return to their towns and villages, where the housing rents and prices are lower.

## Why do cities emerge? {#sec:CityOrigins}
What are the reasons calling the cities into existence? The first known cities were founded in 8th millenium BC, that is, 10,000 years ago (Jericho in present-day Israel with a population of about 2000), in 7th millenium BC (Çatalhöyük in present-day Turkey, with a population of 5000), and in the second half of the 4th millenium BC (Uruk in Southern Mesopotamia, nowadays Irak, with a population of approximately 50,000) [@OSullivan_2008]. Symptomatically, these cities emerged during the Agricultural revolution and in the so-called Fertile Crescent in the Middle Asia, where early transition from hunting and gathering to the agriculture took place.

One of the indispensable prerequisites for the development of cities is a surplus of agricultural production. The urban residents specialize in industrial production, trade, and other non-agricultural activities. Therefore, agricultural workers must produce enough not only to satisfy their own needs, but also to feed the inhabitants of cities. Moreover, the cities must offer economic benefits in order to offset for their evident costs: high land prices, congestion, and pollution.

Here, we will consider a purely market-based model of a city creation and growth, leaving aside all non-economic reasons. In a purely agricultural economy, no cities are expected to emerge. The model of such an economy is based on the following assumptions. First, there only two *production factors*: land and labor. Second, all people have *identical productivity*. It means that every person produces in one hour the same output as any other person. Third, there are *no scale economies*: the agricultural production has *constant returns*. In other words, if the inputs of labor and capital double, the production also doubles. Fourth, there are no other means of transportation as the one's legs. Hence, the *travel time* is identical for everybody, since all (healthy) people are walking with a speed of 4 km/h.

What gives rise to the emergence of cities? The cities can only appear, if some or all of the assumptions of the agricultural economy model are violated. First, thanks to the *comparative advantages* the trade can emerge. The economy must not be autarkic anymore --- everybody can concentrate on the production of goods and services in which he has comparative advantages and exchange them for other goods and services produced by those who possess the corresponding comparative advantages. Second, the existence of *scale economies* contributes decisively to the formation of cities. The scale economies in transportation (e.g., invention of a wheel) allow an increase in the spatial extension of trade, while those in production (e.g., an invention of water mills) lead to the concentration of production. Thus, production is concentrated in some sites, which are for some reason beneficial for the production (proximity to a river or a sea haven, intersection of roads, availability of minerals, etc.), and can serve a large area, where agricultural products and raw materials are produced to be exchanged at the production site for the urban products. Third, if the physical proximity of producers facilitates innovation and learning (e.g., the universities, which attract many students), then individual producers will cluster together and, thus, generate a city. Fourth, a collective consumption of some public good that requires a physical proximity of consumers can also lead to a creation of cities. For example, religious practice can stimulate the development of cities as soon as the small village shrines, where earthen gods are worshiped, are replaced by large temples, where a specialized caste of priesters worship celestial gods [@Mumford_1961].


## Urbanization {#sec:Urbanization}

*Urbanization* is the process of an accelerated population growth in the urban areas. *Urbanization rate* denotes the share of population living in the urban areas.

Figure \@ref(fig:UrbanizationUN) depicts the urbanization process by countries between 1950 and 2010. The darker the color the higher the share of urban population in the country. It can be seen that at the beginning of the period the most urbanized countries were in Australia, Europe, North America, and in part in South America. Over the time, more and more countries become urbanized.

Figure \@ref(fig:RuralUrban) shows the growth of the world rural and urban between 1960 and 2017. Over the whole period, the urban population grew at a much higher rate than the rural one. By 2007, both populations became equal. Since then, more than a half of the world population lives in urban areas.

Figure \@ref(fig:UrbanizationRussia) illustrates the urbanization process in Russia between 1897 and 2010. In the late 19th century, the share of urban population was about 15\%. By 1939, it increased up to 35\%. Only after World War II, the urban population in Russia exceeded the rural one. By the end of the Soviet period, the urbanization rate attained over 70\%. Since then, it remains at the same level.

The population of individual cities, especially of the large ones, substantially increased. Figure \@ref(fig:PopulationPetrograd) depicts the population change in St. Petersburg ---the former capital of the Russian Empire and the second largest city of the Russian Federation--- between 1764 and 2015.

<div class="figure">
<img src="02-Urban_files/figure-html/PopulationPetrograd-1.png" alt="Population of St. Petersburg, 1764--2018" width="672" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:PopulationPetrograd)Population of St. Petersburg, 1764--2018</p>
</div>

The population of St. Petersburg increased from about two million at the eve of World War I to more than five million 100 years later. Due to the city's turbulent history, this evolution was not smooth. During the Russian Civil War, World War II, and in the early 1990s, the population drastically decreased. While the first two decreases were associated with large-scale war events, the last depopulation episode took place during peaceful times and can be explained by a very tough transition from the centrally planned economy to the market one.

The population growth can be decomposed into two components: growth of the population and growth of the administrative city boundaries. As seen in Figure \@ref(fig:MapPetrograd), the territory of St. Petersburg experienced a manifold increase between 1917 and 2017. The largest expansion took place immediately after the Russian Civil War, when the nearest outskirts, mostly industrial areas, of the city were included into its administrative boundaries.

## Why cities are big? {#sec:CitiesBig}
What are the factors encouraging the growth of cities? Do larger cities have more advantages than smaller ones? Indeed, there are several factors that make large cities economically more attractive and successful than their smaller counterparts.

The first factor is the *economies of intra-industry agglomeration*. They occur, when the firms belonging to the same industry locate next to each other. This allows them to purchase the intermediate inputs from a common supplier at a lower cost. In addition, it leads to an increased efficiency of labor market, because the cost of job search in such a case is lower. This is achieved thanks to the transmission of information on vacancies through informal channels and the fact that potential employers are nearby. Moreover, the intra-industry agglomeration creates communication economies, that is, a quick information exchange and technology diffusion.

The second factor is the *urbanization economies*, which stands for concentration in the same place of the firms belonging to the different industries. These firms can still use common suppliers (such as banks, insurance companies, hotels, transport, and publishers) and public services (such as roads, public transit, education, and health care). Provided that these common suppliers have scale economies, the concentration of various firms requiring their products creates a market, which is wide enough in order to take advantage of these economies of scale. Hence, the firms located in the same place can purchase the inputs from the common suppliers and obtain public services at a lower cost.

The third factor is the *trade agglomeration*, which refers to the spatial concentration of trade establishments. It rendered possible thanks to the *external effects of retail trade* meaning that one shop's sales are affected by those of other shops. There are two types of external effects: for complementary goods and for incomplete substitutes. Consider the case of complementary goods, e.g., cloth and shoes. If there is already a shop selling cloth in the neighborhood, then it makes sense for a seller of shoes to open his shop nearby. The customers looking for clothes are likely to need shoes passing to them. Therefore, the shoes shop will be able to capture attention of some of the cloth shop customers. The case of incomplete substitutes is less evident. Indeed, why, say, two building materials or furniture stores can benefit from locating next to each other? It seems that they will compete for the each other's customers and ruin trade. And yet in many cases we observe that such stores are situated close to each other. The reason is that their products are substitutes, but are not exactly identical. Therefore, if somebody needs, say, a hammer he is more likely to travel to the place, where several building materials stores are located, than to the place, where he can find only one such store. In such a way, the customer can save time. Indeed, if he cannot find the hammer he needs in one store, he just has to walk a few meters in order to find a similar store, where he can find what he needs. 


## Why city sizes are different: The theory of central places {#sec:CitiesDifferent}

If we look at the cities and towns, we will immediately see that they vary a lot in in terms of size. As seen in Table \@ref(tab:sizeUrbanAreas), in Russia city sizes vary from just 102 persons to over 12 million. Half of Russian cities have a population below 26,300. In 2010, out of 1100 Russian cities, 12 had population exceeding 1 million and accounted for 28.9\% of the total urban population, 25 cities had population between 0.5 and 1 million (16.2\% of the total urban population).

Why city sizes are so different? Why do not they converge to some ``optimal size'', identical for all cities? The theory of *central places* offers an explanation for this phenomenon. It is a land-use theory that subdivides settlements into classes, according to their importance as central places in the surrounding areas. It was developed in the 1930s by German geographers Walter Christaller (1893--1969) and August Lösch (1906--1945).^[See @Christaller_1933 in German, @Christaller_1966 in English translation, and @Loesch_1944.]

For simplicity, the theory assumes that the surface is uniform and that the population is evenly distributed across it. No natural or human made obstacles exist that would hinder the movements from one part of the surface to another. Therefore, initially the economic agents are indifferent, where to locate their establishments.

Each establishment (or industry) has its optimal activity area. This depends on the price of the good or service, travel cost, and productivity. For example, assume that we have three establishments: a bakery, a physician's practice, and a book store. The bakery can serve an area with a radius of 1 km. People need to buy their bread every day plus the hot bread can become cold, if carried for more than 1 km. Thus, the next baker will open his establishment 2 km away from the existing bakery. Thus, the whole surface will be covered by the bakeries, which are located at 2 km from each other, see small circles in Figure \@ref(fig:CentralPlaces). Note that the areas served by each bakery have a form of a bee cell. This turns out to be an optimal delineation of the markets. The circles would not do because they would result in either unserved regions or in intersections, where both bakers would compete. 

<div class="figure">
<img src="02-Urban_files/figure-html/CentralPlaces-1.png" alt="Central places" width="672" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:CentralPlaces)Central places</p>
</div>

Assume that the doctor has a bigger area he can serve with profit. Let the radius of this area be 2 km. Fortunately, most people do not need to visit a physician every day, so they can afford traveling a couple times a year up to 2 km to their physician's cabinet. Suppose also that the doctor will choose a place for his practice next to a bakery. Maybe he likes cakes or the baker is often ill and visits the doctor. In any case, the place, where both bakery and physician's practice are located, have a larger population. So, they are denoted in Figure \@ref(fig:CentralPlaces) by the middle-sized circles. Given a wide area served by each doctor, the next physician will open his practice 4 km away from hour doctor. Most likely the location of this new cabinet will coincide with that of some of the bakeries.

Finally, assume that the book store serves an area with a radius of 4 km. The books are not some stuff we need to buy on a daily and even on a weekly basis. Hence, the travel distance of up to 4 km will not scare away buyers. The book store will be located in a place, where already a bakery and a physician's practice exist. The resulting place will have an even larger population. That is why it will be denoted by a big circle in Figure \@ref(fig:CentralPlaces).

Thus, the central places theory predicts an emergence of a *hierarchy of cities*: superior order, intermediate order, and inferior order. The bigger cities will have a higher variety of goods and services produced and sold there and, therefore, a larger population. The superior-order places will have all types of goods and services (a bakery, a doctor's cabinet, and a book store). The  intermediate-order places will have less goods and services than the superior-order ones and more than the inferior-order ones, which will have only a bakery. Each place imports goods from the higher-order places and exports to the lower-order ones. The places having the same order do not interact because they have an identical supply structure.
