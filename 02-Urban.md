# Urban economics {#ch:Urban}


## Introduction

In this chapter, we introduce basic notions of the urban economics. *The urban economics* is a theory about the location choice made by firms and households. It answers the following questions:

* Why do the cities emerge?
* Why do cities differ in terms of size?
* What determines the internal structure of the cities?

The urban theory focuses on the cities, which are an important object of research, given their population and contribution to the world economic growth.

Section \@ref(sec:City) defines the notion of city. In section <!-- \ref{sec:City_origins}, the origins of cities are explored. Section \ref{sec:Urbanization} illustrates the process of growth of the urban population known as urbanization. Section \ref{sec:Cities_different} uses the theory of central places in order to explain why city sizes are so different: from little towns to huge megacities. In section \ref{sec:Internal_structure}, the internal structure of cities and location choices made by firms and households. Section \ref{sec:Gradient}, shows the dependence between location (distance from the city center) and population and employment density. -->


## What is a city? {#sec:City}

The question of what makes a settlement an urban area is not an easy one. Different criteria can be employed in order to define a city. The most typical are the size of population, the population density, and the structure of economic activities carried out in the settlement.

*Population size*. In Russia, a settlement can be declared city, if it has population of 12,000 and more and 85\% of its population are not occupied in agriculture.^[This definition is provided by the Decree of Sep. 12, 1957 *On attributing settlements to the category of cities, worker and resort townships*. Interestingly, its predecessor --- the Decree of September 15, 1924 *General provisions on urban and rural settlements* imposed similar but somewhat lower restrictions: 1000 persons and at least 75\% of population occupied in the non-agricultural production.]Currently, urban settlement status is determined by the legislation of federal subjects.

In many countries, a settlement must have some minimum population in order to be treated as a city. Table \@ref(tab:threshold) reports the minimum required population for several countries.
