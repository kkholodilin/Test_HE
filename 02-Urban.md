# Urban economics {#ch:Urban}


## Introduction

In this chapter, we introduce basic notions of the urban economics. *The urban economics* is a theory about the location choice made by firms and households. It answers the following questions:

* Why do the cities emerge?
* Why do cities differ in terms of size?
* What determines the internal structure of the cities?

The urban theory focuses on the cities, which are an important object of research, given their population and contribution to the world economic growth.

Section \@ref(sec:City) defines the notion of city. In section <!-- \ref{sec:City_origins}, the origins of cities are explored. Section \ref{sec:Urbanization} illustrates the process of growth of the urban population known as urbanization. Section \ref{sec:Cities_different} uses the theory of central places in order to explain why city sizes are so different: from little towns to huge megacities. In section \ref{sec:Internal_structure}, the internal structure of cities and location choices made by firms and households. Section \ref{sec:Gradient}, shows the dependence between location (distance from the city center) and population and employment density. -->


## What is a city? {#sec:City}

The question of what makes a settlement an urban area is not an easy one. Different criteria can be employed in order to define a city. The most typical are the size of population, the population density, and the structure of economic activities carried out in the settlement.

*Population size*. In Russia, a settlement can be declared city, if it has population of 12,000 and more and 85\% of its population are not occupied in agriculture.^[This definition is provided by the Decree of Sep. 12, 1957 *On attributing settlements to the category of cities, worker and resort townships*. Interestingly, its predecessor --- the Decree of September 15, 1924 *General provisions on urban and rural settlements* imposed similar but somewhat lower restrictions: 1000 persons and at least 75\% of population occupied in the non-agricultural production.]Currently, urban settlement status is determined by the legislation of federal subjects.

In many countries, a settlement must have some minimum population in order to be treated as a city. Table \@ref(tab:threshold) reports the minimum required population for several countries.

Denmark and Sweden                        250
France and Israel                        1000
Mexico and USA                           2000
Azerbaijan and Georgia                   2500
Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Ukraine, etc.       5000
Russia                                  10000
Japan                                   12000

The minimum population varies a lot: from as few as 250 persons in Denmark and Sweden to as many as 30,000 in Japan. In practice, despite the existence of the official minimum threshold, the population of the cities can be well below it. Figure \@ref(fig:boxplotUrbanAreas) and Table \@ref(tab:sizeUrbanAreas) report the descriptive statistics of the distribution of the population of Russian cities and towns (*goroda*) as well as urban villages (*posyolki gorodskogo tipa*) in 2017.

In general, the population in cities and towns is much larger than that of the urban villages. It also mostly exceeds 12,000. However, the lower tail of distribution lies below 1000 persons.

According to Table \@ref(tab:sizeUrbanAreas), there are 1112 cities or towns and 1183 urban villages in Russia.

Maximum, persons        12,380,000 (Moscow)          41,980 (Nakhabino, Moscow reg.) 

The median population of cities or towns is 26,300, which is more than twice as large as the minimum threshold. However, almost one-fourth of all cities and towns are close to or below that lower boundary. The smallest and probably the youngest town Innopolis has slightly more than 100 inhabitants, while the smallest urban village Kozhym has only four residents.
