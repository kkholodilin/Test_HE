["introduction.html", "Chapter 1 Introduction Recommended reading", " Chapter 1 Introduction This textbook is intended to serve as an introduction into the housing economics for the higher school students and all other persons interested in this topic. It covers six major topics, which are briefly described below. Chapter 2 provides an introduction to urban economics. It shows the mportance and main principles of the urban economics. It discusses the emergence and development of cities and describes the urbanization process. Using the theory of central places of Christaller and L\"osch it explains the large differences existing between city sizes. In addition, it takes advantage of the Alonso-Mills-Muth model of land use in the city in order to explain the internal structure of cities. Finally, it presents the evidence of the population and employment density gradient. In chapter 3, the main general and specific features of the housing market are presented: heterogeneity, immobility, and expensiveness. Moreover, a stock and flow model of the housing market is introduced that illustrates the interplay of the housing supply and demand as well as the short-run rigidity of supply. In addition, it discusses the housing vacancy and affordability. The narrative is supported by a rich evidence about the housing market in Russia and abroad. Chapter 4 focuses on the valuation of the real estate. Alternative approaches to valuing the heterogeneous and immobile good ``housing’’ are presented. In more detail the techniques stemming from the sales comparison method are considered, such as stratified valuation method, repeat-sales methods of Bailey and Case-Schiller, and hedonic regression. These isolate the impact of structural and locational factors on the housing price from that of the inflationary price increases. Finally, the models capturing the spatial dependence between housing prices are introduced. In chapter 5, the issue of speculative housing price bubbles is considered. It provides the definition of speculative bubbles as large and long lasting decoupling between the actual and fundamental prices. The chapter shows the importance of the early warning systems, which are used to predict the build-up of speculative price bubbles. Alternative methods of identifying speculative housing price bubbles, such as ad hoc, fundamental value regressions, and explosive root tests are presented. In addition, various methods of predicting speculative housing price bubbles —signalling approach and discrete-choice models— are considered. Finally, non-linear models for identification and prediction of speculative bubbles —threshold autoregression, smooth transition autoregression, and Markov-switching regression— are discussed. Chapter 6 concentrates on the housing tenure choice. It starts from defining the notion of tenure and describing various tenure types. Then, the focus is made on the dichotomy between the owner-occupied and tenant-occupied housing. In particular, the importance of the homeownership as shown and its advantages and disadvantages from the standpoint of individuals and society are compared. The chapter considers theoretical models explaining the choice between the owner-occupied and rental housing, which are based on the notion of the user cost. The chapter concludes with the analysis of the spatio-temporal variation of the homeownership rates. Chapter 7 is devoted to the governmental intervention in the housing market. It thoroughly discusses objectives and tools of such intervention. In this chapter, the indices measuring the intensity of restrictive governmental housing market regulations are presented. Finally, the indices are used to trace the evolution of the rental regulation intensity worldwide during the last century. In the end of each chapter, a set of control questions and discussion topics is presented. In addition, a list of key terms is provided. The material presented here has been used in 2018–2020, when the author has had a nice opportunity to teach the course of housing economics by the undergraduate students at the NRU HSE in St. Petersburg. The textbook contains lots of empirical evidence to illustrate theoretical concepts. Particular weight is placed on discussing the Russian experience.

The urban economics is a theory about the location choice made by firms and households. It answers the following questions: Why do the cities emerge? Why do cities differ in terms of size? What determines the internal structure of the cities? The urban theory focuses on the cities, which are an important object of research, given their population and contribution to the world economic growth. Section 2.2 defines the notion of city. In section 2.3, the origins of cities are explored. Section 2.4 illustrates the process of growth of the urban population known as urbanization. In Section 2.5, some explanations are offered, why cities tend to grow and become big. Section 2.6 uses the theory of central places in order to explain why city sizes are so different: from little towns to huge megacities. In section @sec:(InternalStructure), the internal structure of cities and location choices made by firms and households. Section 2.8, shows the dependence between location (distance from the city center) and population and employment density. 2.2 What is a city? The question of what makes a settlement an urban area is not an easy one. Different criteria can be employed in order to define a city. The most typical are the size of population, the population density, and the structure of economic activities carried out in the settlement. Population size. In Russia, a settlement can be declared city, if it has population of 12,000 and more and 85% of its population are not occupied in agriculture.1Currently, urban settlement status is determined by the legislation of federal subjects. In many countries, a settlement must have some minimum population in order to be treated as a city. Table 2.1 reports the minimum required population for several countries. Table 2.1: Definition of city: country-specific population thresholds Country Citizen Denmark and Sweden 250 France and Israel 1000 Mexico and USA 2000 Azerbaijan and Georgia 2500 Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Ukraine, etc. 5000 Russia 10000 Japan 12000 The minimum population varies a lot: from as few as 250 persons in Denmark and Sweden to as many as 30,000 in Japan. In practice, despite the existence of the official minimum threshold, the population of the cities can be well below it. Figure 2.1 and Table 2.2 report the descriptive statistics of the distribution of the population of Russian cities and towns (goroda) as well as urban villages (posyolki gorodskogo tipa) in 2017. Figure 2.1: The size of Russia’s urban areas, 2017 In general, the population in cities and towns is much larger than that of the urban villages. It also mostly exceeds 12,000. However, the lower tail of distribution lies below 1000 persons. According to Table 2.2, there are 1112 cities or towns and 1183 urban villages in Russia. Table 2.2: Size of Russia’s urban areas, 2017 Statistic City or town Urban village Number of areas 1112 1183 Minimum, persons 102 (Innopolis, Tatarstan) 4 (Kozhym, Komi Republic) 1st quartile, persons 13,130 2876 Median, persons 26,300 4934 Mean, persons 91,770 6061 3rd quartile, persons 59,020 7846 Maximum, persons 12,380,000 (Moscow) 41,980 (Nakhabino, Moscow reg.) The median population of cities or towns is 26,300, which is more than twice as large as the minimum threshold. However, almost one-fourth of all cities and towns are close to or below that lower boundary. The smallest and probably the youngest town Innopolis has slightly more than 100 inhabitants, while the smallest urban village Kozhym has only four residents. Population density. Given the ambiguity of the population size as criterion for defining a city or a town, other indicators are suggested. For example, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) suggested using the population density in order to identify the so-called functional urban areas (FUA), which are its proxies for cities (OECD 2013). The OECD uses a three-step algorithm in order to delineate the FUAs. In the first step, the urbanized areas, or ``urban high-density clusters’’, are defined over the national territory, ignoring administrative borders. For this purpose, the national territory is divided by a continuous grid with a cell size of 1 km\\(^2\\). The urban core then is identified as a high-density cluster of contiguous grid cells of 1 km\\(^2\\) with a density of at least 1,500 inhabitants per km\\(^2\\) (1000 in Canada and USA). In the second step, the non-contiguous cores belonging to the same functional urban area are connected. This is done in order to account for the polycentric cities. Their belonging to the same FUA is determined based on the commuting intensity between cores. If many people are commuting between the neighbor cores, then all these cores are thought to belong to the same FUA. In the third step, the urban hinterlands are identified. These are defined as all municipalities with at least 15% of their employed residents working in a certain urban core. Figure 2.2 shows an example of the FUAs as determined by the OECD for the case of Germany. Green color denotes the urban cores of the FUAs, while the red areas stand for their hinterlands. Figure 2.2: Functional urban areas of OECD in Germany It can be seen that the FUAs go beyond the administrative boundaries of the officially defined cities. For example, the largest FUA in the east of Germany unifies Berlin, Potsdam, and their immediate surroundings. Its hinterland stretches for dozens of kilometers around the core. People living in these areas commute every day to the core, where the jobs are concentrated and return to their towns and villages, where the housing rents and prices are lower. 2.3 Why do cities emerge? What are the reasons calling the cities into existence? The first known cities were founded in 8th millenium BC, that is, 10,000 years ago (Jericho in present-day Israel with a population of about 2000), in 7th millenium BC (Çatalhöyük in present-day Turkey, with a population of 5000), and in the second half of the 4th millenium BC (Uruk in Southern Mesopotamia, nowadays Irak, with a population of approximately 50,000) (O’Sullivan 2008). Symptomatically, these cities emerged during the Agricultural revolution and in the so-called Fertile Crescent in the Middle Asia, where early transition from hunting and gathering to the agriculture took place. One of the indispensable prerequisites for the development of cities is a surplus of agricultural production. The urban residents specialize in industrial production, trade, and other non-agricultural activities. Therefore, agricultural workers must produce enough not only to satisfy their own needs, but also to feed the inhabitants of cities. Moreover, the cities must offer economic benefits in order to offset for their evident costs: high land prices, congestion, and pollution. Here, we will consider a purely market-based model of a city creation and growth, leaving aside all non-economic reasons. In a purely agricultural economy, no cities are expected to emerge. The model of such an economy is based on the following assumptions. First, there only two production factors: land and labor. Second, all people have identical productivity. It means that every person produces in one hour the same output as any other person. Third, there are no scale economies: the agricultural production has constant returns. In other words, if the inputs of labor and capital double, the production also doubles. Fourth, there are no other means of transportation as the one’s legs. Hence, the travel time is identical for everybody, since all (healthy) people are walking with a speed of 4 km/h. What gives rise to the emergence of cities? The cities can only appear, if some or all of the assumptions of the agricultural economy model are violated. First, thanks to the comparative advantages the trade can emerge. The economy must not be autarkic anymore — everybody can concentrate on the production of goods and services in which he has comparative advantages and exchange them for other goods and services produced by those who possess the corresponding comparative advantages. Second, the existence of scale economies contributes decisively to the formation of cities. The scale economies in transportation (e.g., invention of a wheel) allow an increase in the spatial extension of trade, while those in production (e.g., an invention of water mills) lead to the concentration of production. Thus, production is concentrated in some sites, which are for some reason beneficial for the production (proximity to a river or a sea haven, intersection of roads, availability of minerals, etc.), and can serve a large area, where agricultural products and raw materials are produced to be exchanged at the production site for the urban products. Third, if the physical proximity of producers facilitates innovation and learning (e.g., the universities, which attract many students), then individual producers will cluster together and, thus, generate a city. Fourth, a collective consumption of some public good that requires a physical proximity of consumers can also lead to a creation of cities. For example, religious practice can stimulate the development of cities as soon as the small village shrines, where earthen gods are worshiped, are replaced by large temples, where a specialized caste of priesters worship celestial gods (Mumford 1961). 2.4 Urbanization Urbanization is the process of an accelerated population growth in the urban areas. Urbanization rate denotes the share of population living in the urban areas. Figure 2.3 depicts the urbanization process by countries between 1950 and 2010. The darker the color the higher the share of urban population in the country. It can be seen that at the beginning of the period the most urbanized countries were in Australia, Europe, North America, and in part in South America. Over the time, more and more countries become urbanized. Figure 2.3: Urbanization in the world, 1950–2010 Source: United Nations World Development Indicators. Figure 2.4 shows the growth of the world rural and urban between 1960 and 2017. Over the whole period, the urban population grew at a much higher rate than the rural one. By 2007, both populations became equal. Since then, more than a half of the world population lives in urban areas. Figure 2.4: Rural vs. urban population in the world, 1960–2017 Figure 2.5 illustrates the urbanization process in Russia between 1897 and 2010. In the late 19th century, the share of urban population was about 15%. By 1939, it increased up to 35%. Only after World War II, the urban population in Russia exceeded the rural one. By the end of the Soviet period, the urbanization rate attained over 70%. Since then, it remains at the same level. Figure 2.5: Urbanization in Russia, 1897–2010 The population of individual cities, especially of the large ones, substantially increased. Figure 2.6 depicts the population change in St. Petersburg —the former capital of the Russian Empire and the second largest city of the Russian Federation— between 1764 and 2015. Figure 2.6: Population of St. Petersburg, 1764–2018 The population of St. Petersburg increased from about two million at the eve of World War I to more than five million 100 years later. Due to the city’s turbulent history, this evolution was not smooth. During the Russian Civil War, World War II, and in the early 1990s, the population drastically decreased. While the first two decreases were associated with large-scale war events, the last depopulation episode took place during peaceful times and can be explained by a very tough transition from the centrally planned economy to the market one. The population growth can be decomposed into two components: growth of the population and growth of the administrative city boundaries. As seen in Figure 2.7, the territory of St. Petersburg experienced a manifold increase between 1917 and 2017. The largest expansion took place immediately after the Russian Civil War, when the nearest outskirts, mostly industrial areas, of the city were included into its administrative boundaries. Figure 2.7: Territorial expansion of St. Petersburg, 1917–2017 Source: own representation 2.5 Why cities are big? What are the factors encouraging the growth of cities? Do larger cities have more advantages than smaller ones? Indeed, there are several factors that make large cities economically more attractive and successful than their smaller counterparts. The first factor is the economies of intra-industry agglomeration. They occur, when the firms belonging to the same industry locate next to each other. This allows them to purchase the intermediate inputs from a common supplier at a lower cost. In addition, it leads to an increased efficiency of labor market, because the cost of job search in such a case is lower. This is achieved thanks to the transmission of information on vacancies through informal channels and the fact that potential employers are nearby. Moreover, the intra-industry agglomeration creates communication economies, that is, a quick information exchange and technology diffusion. The second factor is the urbanization economies, which stands for concentration in the same place of the firms belonging to the different industries. These firms can still use common suppliers (such as banks, insurance companies, hotels, transport, and publishers) and public services (such as roads, public transit, education, and health care). Provided that these common suppliers have scale economies, the concentration of various firms requiring their products creates a market, which is wide enough in order to take advantage of these economies of scale. Hence, the firms located in the same place can purchase the inputs from the common suppliers and obtain public services at a lower cost. The third factor is the trade agglomeration, which refers to the spatial concentration of trade establishments. It rendered possible thanks to the external effects of retail trade meaning that one shop’s sales are affected by those of other shops. There are two types of external effects: for complementary goods and for incomplete substitutes. Consider the case of complementary goods, e.g., cloth and shoes. If there is already a shop selling cloth in the neighborhood, then it makes sense for a seller of shoes to open his shop nearby. The customers looking for clothes are likely to need shoes passing to them. Therefore, the shoes shop will be able to capture attention of some of the cloth shop customers. The case of incomplete substitutes is less evident. Indeed, why, say, two building materials or furniture stores can benefit from locating next to each other? It seems that they will compete for the each other’s customers and ruin trade. And yet in many cases we observe that such stores are situated close to each other. The reason is that their products are substitutes, but are not exactly identical. Therefore, if somebody needs, say, a hammer he is more likely to travel to the place, where several building materials stores are located, than to the place, where he can find only one such store. In such a way, the customer can save time. Indeed, if he cannot find the hammer he needs in one store, he just has to walk a few meters in order to find a similar store, where he can find what he needs. 2.6 Why city sizes are different: The theory of central places If we look at the cities and towns, we will immediately see that they vary a lot in in terms of size. As seen in Table 2.2, in Russia city sizes vary from just 102 persons to over 12 million. Half of Russian cities have a population below 26,300. In 2010, out of 1100 Russian cities, 12 had population exceeding 1 million and accounted for 28.9% of the total urban population, 25 cities had population between 0.5 and 1 million (16.2% of the total urban population). Table 2.3: Number and population of Russian cities, 2010 Category by population 1000 Number of cities Population 1000 Share of population percent &lt;50 781 16,445 16.9 50-100 155 11,083 11.1 100-250 91 13,817 14.5 250-500 36 14,574 12.4 500-1000 25 12,403 16.2 1000+ 12 27,416 28.9 Total 1100 97,527 100.0 Source: Росстат (2012). Why city sizes are so different? Why do not they converge to some “optimal size”, identical for all cities? The theory of central places offers an explanation for this phenomenon. It is a land-use theory that subdivides settlements into classes, according to their importance as central places in the surrounding areas. It was developed in the 1930s by German geographers Walter Christaller (1893–1969) and August Lösch (1906–1945): see Christaller (1933) in German, Christaller (1966) in English translation, and Lösch (1944). For simplicity, the theory assumes that the surface is uniform and that the population is evenly distributed across it. No natural or human made obstacles exist that would hinder the movements from one part of the surface to another. Therefore, initially the economic agents are indifferent, where to locate their establishments. Each establishment (or industry) has its optimal activity area. This depends on the price of the good or service, travel cost, and productivity. For example, assume that we have three establishments: a bakery, a physician’s practice, and a book store. The bakery can serve an area with a radius of 1 km. People need to buy their bread every day plus the hot bread can become cold, if carried for more than 1 km. Thus, the next baker will open his establishment 2 km away from the existing bakery. Thus, the whole surface will be covered by the bakeries, which are located at 2 km from each other, see small circles in Figure 2.8. Note that the areas served by each bakery have a form of a bee cell. This turns out to be an optimal delineation of the markets. The circles would not do because they would result in either unserved regions or in intersections, where both bakers would compete. Figure 2.8: Central places Assume that the doctor has a bigger area he can serve with profit. Let the radius of this area be 2 km. Fortunately, most people do not need to visit a physician every day, so they can afford traveling a couple times a year up to 2 km to their physician’s cabinet. Suppose also that the doctor will choose a place for his practice next to a bakery. Maybe he likes cakes or the baker is often ill and visits the doctor. In any case, the place, where both bakery and physician’s practice are located, have a larger population. So, they are denoted in Figure 2.8 by the middle-sized circles. Given a wide area served by each doctor, the next physician will open his practice 4 km away from hour doctor. Most likely the location of this new cabinet will coincide with that of some of the bakeries. Finally, assume that the book store serves an area with a radius of 4 km. The books are not some stuff we need to buy on a daily and even on a weekly basis. Hence, the travel distance of up to 4 km will not scare away buyers. The book store will be located in a place, where already a bakery and a physician’s practice exist. The resulting place will have an even larger population. That is why it will be denoted by a big circle in Figure 2.8. Thus, the central places theory predicts an emergence of a hierarchy of cities: superior order, intermediate order, and inferior order. The bigger cities will have a higher variety of goods and services produced and sold there and, therefore, a larger population. The superior-order places will have all types of goods and services (a bakery, a doctor’s cabinet, and a book store). The intermediate-order places will have less goods and services than the superior-order ones and more than the inferior-order ones, which will have only a bakery. Each place imports goods from the higher-order places and exports to the lower-order ones. The places having the same order do not interact because they have an identical supply structure. The theory of central places is not simply an abstract concept that only theoretical economists or geographers use. It is utilized in some countries for the purposes of planning the allocation of resources. For example, Figure 2.9 shows a map of central places in Germany constructed by the BBSR (Bundesinstitut für Bau-, Stadt- und Raumforschung (Deutscher Bundestag 2017)). Figure 2.9: Central places in Germany Source: BBSR This map was developed by a German research institute BBSR, which is a part of the German federal government. The red squares denote the superior-order central places, while the blue circles stand for the intermediate-order central places. The spatial pattern observed in the map does not remind the bee cells as predicted by the theory. Such a deviation of the practice from the theory can be explained by the effects of geographical, historical, and political factors. 2.7 The internal structure of cities 2.7.1 The land use model of von Thünen The origins of the modern model of a monocentric city are in the pioneering work of Johann Heinrich von Thünen (1783–1850), who in 1842 suggested a model of land use. The original work von Thünen (1826) can be read in Google Books, while English translation is available as von Thünen (1966). His purpose was to identify where to locate different agricultural activities. The attraction point is the nearest city, where the market for agricultural products is situated. Different agricultural produces have different production and transportation costs. Therefore, the questions von Thünen intended to address were: How far from the city, say, potatoes and corn be cultivated or cows raised? Although, originally, von Thünen’s theory was used for agriculture. However, it can be easily extended to the urban economy. In the von Thünen’s model, the land rent is the maximum possible amount that an agricultural producer can pay for the use of land. \\[\\begin{equation} R = (P-C)Q - \\tau Q d \\tag{2.1} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(R\\) is the land rent (euros/km\\(^2\\)); \\(P\\) is the market price of the crop (euros/t); \\(C\\) is the production cost of the crop (euros/t); \\(Q\\) is the yield (t/km\\(^2\\)); \\(\\tau\\) is the transportation cost (euros/t/km); \\(d\\) is the distance from the market (city). Figure 2.10 compares two land rent functions for two agricultural produces: A and B. Figure 2.10: Land use: von Thuenen’s land rent As the main factor that makes difference in space is the distance to the city (market), different agricultural activities will occupy segments at different distances from the city. Thus, they will form rings around the city, as shown in Figure 2.11. Figure 2.11: Land use: von Thuenen’s product rings 2.7.2 Alonso-Mills-Muth model The modern theory of monocentric city structure suggested by William Alonso (1933-1999), Edwin Mills (born in 1928), and Richard Muth (born in 1927) (Alonso 1964; Mills 1972; Muth 1975). Its aim is to explain the land use in a monocentric city, that is, a city having only one center. Below, we consider this theory from the viewpoints of production and consumption. The following discussion is to a large extent based on Mills (1972). Let us consider first the land use in a monocentric city from the production side perspective. The model is based on the following assumptions: all goods are produced using the land and capital; the production function has constant returns to scale and permits substitution between the land and capital; the input and output markets are perfectly competitive implying that all firms are pricetakers; the supply of capital is perfectly elastic to the urban area, i.e., it is equally available throughout the whole city; the rental rate on capital, \\(i\\), is the same throughout the whole urban area; the land rent, \\(R(d)\\) is determined by the model and depends on distance from city center. The production function of a firm can be formulated as follows: \\[\\begin{equation} x = f\\Big(K(d), L(d)\\Big) \\tag{2.2} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(x\\) is the non-housing output (e.g., production of consumer goods); \\(d\\) is the distance from production site to city center; \\(K(d)\\) is the use of capital (say, equipment or buildings); and \\(L(d)\\) is the use of land (i.e., the territory occupied by the factory). Its only difference from the production function in the standard microeconomic theory is the distance, \\(d\\). In such a way from the spaceless world the firm is transfered into the world, where distance matters and creates additional obstacles for the market participants. Based on the production function in equation (2.2) the profit of the firm can be calculated: \\[\\begin{equation} \\pi = px - i K(d) - R(d) L(d) - \\tau x d \\end{equation}\\] where \\(p\\) is the unit price of output (euros); \\(i\\) is the interest rate on capital; \\(R(d)\\) is the land rent per \\(m^2\\); and \\(\\tau\\) is the cost of transporting 1 product unit for 1 km. The first-order conditions of the profit maximization problem are as follows: \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{\\partial\\pi}{\\partial K(d)} = \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial K(d)}(p - \\tau d) - i = 0 \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation*} \\frac{\\partial\\pi}{\\partial L(d)} = \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial L(d)}(p- \\tau d) - R(d) = 0 \\end{equation*}\\] The resulting rent function is:% (\\(\\pi=0\\)): \\[\\begin{equation} R(d) = \\frac{\\partial x}{\\partial L(d)}(p - \\tau d) \\end{equation}\\] According to the rent function, two predictions can be made. First, the land rent decreases with distance from city center: the closer to the center the higher the land rent, as shown in Figure 2.12. Second, due to the factor substitution the land rent grows faster than linear at small values of \\(d\\). Indeed, when the land becomes more expensive, the firms began using it more intensively by constructing higher buildings and by offsetting in such a way lower land use by a large use of the capital. Figure 2.12: Land use in a monocentric city: rent function Now, let us approach the land use in a monocentric city from the consumption side. Here, we concentrate on the model of household location choice. This model is based on the following assumptions: Household has utility function describing its tastes for housing services, \\(h\\), and non-housing goods and services, \\(x\\). The location choice, or the distance from center, \\(d\\), affects both the utility as subjective costs of commuting (time foregone for other activities, fatigue, strain, and boredom) and the budget constraint as commuting costs. Households maximize their utility with respect to consumption of housing, goods, and commuting subject to budget constraint. The following mathematical model of household location choice can be formulated: \\[\\begin{equation}\\begin{array}{l} \\mbox{Utility: }U = g(x, h, d)\\\\ \\mbox{Budget constraint: }px+r(d)h + \\tau d = w \\end{array} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(U\\) is the household utility; \\(p\\) is the price of non-housing goods and services; \\(r(d)\\) is the housing rent; \\(\\tau\\) is the commuting cost; \\(d\\) is the distance from city center; and \\(w\\) is the household’s income. Figure 2.13 shows the household indifference curve illustrating his choice between the non-housing and housing consumption. Figure 2.13: Household location choice In equilibrium, the rate of substituion of the housing consumption for the non-housing consumption is equal to the ratio of the non-housing price to the price of housing: \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{\\Delta h}{\\Delta x} = -\\frac{p}{r} \\Rightarrow p\\Delta x(d) + \\Delta r(d)h(d) = 0 \\end{equation}\\] The budget constraint of the household: \\[\\begin{equation} px(d)+r(d)h(d) + \\tau d = w \\end{equation}\\] The effect of a small change in \\(d\\): \\[\\begin{equation} p\\Delta x(d)+\\Delta r(d) h(d) + \\Delta r(d)\\Delta h(d) + r(d)\\Delta h(d) + \\tau \\Delta d = 0 \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\Delta r(d)\\Delta h(d) \\approx 0 \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} r(d)\\Delta h(d) + \\tau \\Delta d = 0 \\end{equation}\\] The resulting housing rent/price function: \\[\\begin{equation} \\frac{\\Delta r(d)}{\\Delta d} = -\\frac{\\tau}{h(d)} \\end{equation}\\] The housing rent function has negative slope. This implies that the housing is more expensive close to city center than in suburbs. Moreover, the rent function is steep wherever \\(h\\) is small: if suburban households consume more housing than those living in center, then the function is steeper close to city center, as shown in Figure 2.14. Figure 2.14: Household location choice: city center vs. suburbs The housing rent function has important implications in terms of the population density within cities. First, the suburbanites (the persons living in the suburbs of a city) consume more housing than residents living close to the city center. Second, since the land is cheaper relative to other housing inputs in suburbs than close to city center, suburban housing uses lower capital-to-land ratios. This means that, all other things being equal, we can expect that the residential buildings will be larger in the central parts of the city and smaller in the suburbs. This is a typical structure of a North American city: while in the center the residents are living in the multi-storey apartment buildings, in the suburbs they occupy spacious single-family houses. Third, in the suburbs, the population densities is predicted to be lower than near to the city center. This is closely related to the second implication: higher population density in the central districts is directly related to the higher intensity of land use there. Indeed, a plot of land occupied by an apartment building will provide more housing units than a land plot with exactly the same area but occupied by the single-family houses. More housing units means more inhabitants, even accounting for the fact that the families living in the single-family houses tend to be larger. Fourth, the model predicts a certain spatial income distribution of the households: Let the disutility of 1 km of commuting be proportionate to wage, equally for high- and low-income workers. If income elasticity of demand for housing exceeds 1, then high-income workers will live farther from the city center; see Figure 2.15. By contrast, if income elasticity is lower than 1, then high-income workers will, nevertheless, live farther out, provided that demand for housing is not too inelastic with respect to its price. Figure 2.15: Land use in a monocentric city: rich vs. poor The income-specific household location choice can also have alternative explanations. According to the transport mode choice explanation, the poor cannot afford automobiles and must rely upon public transit. Unlike the suburbs, the central districts of the cities have a dense enough public transit network. Therefore, the poor must live in central cities in order to have mobility. Another explanation is related to the age of dwellings. The rich prefer newer housing because it has higher quality corresponding to the latest standards, while poor can tolerate the old housing, which is equipped with basic utilities. In some cases, even nowadays, one can find old buildings near to the city center without bath or central heating. The newer houses are more likely to be found in suburbs, while the older ones tend to locate in the central districts. In the USA, poor typically live close to central business district (CBD), while rich in suburbs. In European countries, often an opposite case is observed. For example, in Paris, rich live in the CBD. Brueckner, Thisse, and Zenou (1999) use the cases of Paris and Detroit in order to explain this difference in the spatial distribution of the rich and poor. Their explanation relies upon the urban amenities (historical monuments, fine architecture, etc.) and natural amenities (ocean or river front). These amenities positively affect the housing prices and rents for dwellings located nearby. Moreover, the rich value living near them more than the poor. In Paris, urban amenities are concentrated in the city center, while Detroit has no such amenities at all. This can be generalized for many old cities in Europe having a long and glorious history and the cities in the US having virtually no history. Now, we can put together different sides of the same picture, namely production and consumption sides. Together, they deliver a stylized picture of the spatial distribution of different city activities (sectors), see Figure 2.16. Figure 2.16: Land use in a monocentric city: multiple sectors As seen, the model predictes the following spatial location of industries. The sectors are ranked by distance from city center in order in which they are ranked by steepness of their rent-bid function. In other words, the industry with the steepest rent-bid function is closest to CBD. The manufacturing firms locate close to centrally located port or rail facilities to export their output and import inputs, because they require large amounts of raw and processed materials. The service sector firms (e.g., office activities) require demand of the entire urban area to exhaust their scale economies. Office activities entail much less rapidly diminishing returns with increases in capital-to-land ratio than manufacturing. The labor is their most important input. Moreover, the workers are much less expensive to transport vertically using elevators than materials. An example of real land use pattern can be seen in Figure 2.17, which shows the zoning of St. Petersburg in 2003. Figure 2.17: Land use in St. Petersburg The industrial zones form the so-called “gray ring” around St. Petersburg’s city center. This is typical for many former Soviet cities. The residential areas are located farther outward, surrounded by the recreational and agricultural zones. In fact, the map reflects the vision of the city planning authorities. However, at least for 2003 it accurately reflected the spatial distribution of different sectors, which quite closely mimics the stylized picture predicted by the land use theory that we discuss here. In urban economics, as distance from city center increases, the land prices decrease; the population and employment density go down; the social composition of population changes; and the share of rented dwellings decreases ceding place to the owner-occupied dwellings (Blanco Blanco 2014, 46–50). Figure 2.18 illustrates this for London using the spatial distribution of the share of private sector tenants by wards.2 Figure 2.18: Private tenants as proportion of all households in London by ward, 2011 Source: Mayor of London (2015), p. 13. As seen, the highest proportions (above 40%) are attained in the central wards, while toward the periphery of the city the share of tenants declines. An inverse picture is obtained, when the proportion of homeowners is depicted. 2.8 Density gradient The city land use theory predicts the population and employment density decreasing as the distance from the city center increases. This negative dependence between the density and the distance from the city center can be described using the notion of density gradient. Formally, the density gradient can be expressed as follows: \\[\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:CBD_expon} p(d) = p(0) e^{-\\gamma d\\varepsilon} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(p(d)\\) is the population or employment density at \\(d\\) km from CBD, persons/km\\(^2\\); \\(d\\) is the distance from city center, km; \\(p(0)\\) is the population or employment density in the CBD, persons/km\\(^2\\); \\(\\gamma\\) is the density gradient; and \\(\\varepsilon\\) is the random error. The random error is introduced in order to reflect a real situation. In the real world, the population density cannot be explained by the distance from the center alone. Moreover, the density can be measured with mistakes. Thus, the random error reflects both various factors contributing to the determination of the population density, but omitted in our model, and the measurement mistakes. Figure 2.19 compares different gradients. The larger the absolute value of \\(\\gamma\\) the steeper the slope of the population density function and the quicker the density declines as the distance from the city center increases. Figure 2.19: Alternative stylized population density gradients The population and employment density gradients are affected by various factors. First, the density gradients become flatter with the income: as the income per city resident increases, the residents can enjoy a higher housing consumption. Therefore, they will occupy more space, which will lead to a lower population density. Second, \\(\\gamma\\) shrinks with a growing population of the city, since it leads to a denser population in the less-developed areas and to an expansion at the urban fringe (city expands its boundaries). In many cases, the population growth in the city is accompanied by the decline of the population density in the central areas of the city. Third, the density gradient flattens as a result of improvements in transport performance. Falling transportation costs and higher speed allow more people to settle down farther from the city center and still enjoy a relatively easy access to the jobs and urban amenities located in the CBD. As examples of such developments one can mention the advent of the electric trams and of the personal cars that permitted an extreme expansion of the city boundaries. To a large extent, the modern levels of urbanization owe to the technological progress that greatly improved human mobility. Figure 2.20 illustrates the spatial distribution of the population density in St. Petersburg in 2015. Figure 2.20: Population density in St. Petersburg, 2015 Sources: Petrostat and own representation. Contrary to the predictions of the theory of the land use in monocentric city, the central parts of St. Petersburg are not those with the highest population densities. The population density is very high in the so-called “dormitory districts”, where residential high-rise building dominate the landscape. It can also be explained by governmental regulations. For example, the height restrictions prohibit erecting buildings exceeding a certain threshold in the city center. In addition, the delayed deindustrialization permitted a conservation of the “gray industrial ring” of St. Petersburg around its center, thus, preventing its conversion into higher-density residential areas. The information contained in Figure 2.20 can be made even more visible in Figure 2.21, which shows the relation between the distance from the centroid of St. Petersburg and population and employment density. Figure 2.21: Distribution of population and employment density by distance from the centroid in St. Petersburg, 2015 Sources: Petrostat and own representation. Within approximately 15 km from the city centroid, the population density remains almost unchanged, one exception being the industrial ``gray ring’’ at around 8–9 km from the centroid of the city. A large outlier at about 23 km is an industrial town within the agglomeration of of St. Petersburg (Metallostroy). The employment density follows a pattern, which is very similar to that predicted by the theory. Once again, Metallostroy stands out as an outlier. For comparison, consider the spatial distribution of population density in Berlin by 447 LOR (lebensweltlich orientierte Räume) areas, see Figure 2.22. Figure 2.22: Population density in Berlin, 2015 Sources: Senatsverwaltung für Stadtentwicklung und Wohnen and own representation. Berlin has a comparable population with that of St. Petersburg: 3.5 vs. 5 million, respectively. However, the population density patterns in both cities are very different. Berlin fits much better into the distribution predicted by the theory. Berlin experienced a large-scale deindustrialization after World War II, since many factories were relocated to West Germany. Figure 2.23 depicts the population density as a function of distance from the centroid of Berlin. Figure 2.23: Distribution of population density by distance from the centroid in Berlin, 2015 Sources: Senatsverwaltung für Stadtentwicklung und Wohnen and own representation. In Berlin, unlike in St. Petersburg, the population density diminishes in a more consistent way as the distance from the geographical center of the city increases. A relatively low population density within 3 km from the center is due to the fact that the central part of Berlin is occupied by large park Tiergarten. How does the population gradient look like worldwide. Bertaud and Malpezzi (2014) investigate the empirics of population gradient for many cities and obtained a number of interesting results. The negative exponential density gradient implied by the urban model fits data well. However, in some cities, large deviations are observed. Seoul is an example of the market economy, but extremely strict land use regulations shape spatial distribution of its population density. The layout of Brasilia and Moscow is a result of central planning. Brasilia was built in 1960 from the scratch as the new capital of Brazil and was planned using the rationalist ideas of Charles-Edouard Le Corbusier (1887–1965), while Moscow was largely re-designed in the 1930s.3 Capetown is a city developed under apartheid, which was divided into two cities: one for the whites and another for the colored people.

The housing market possesses the standard elements of any market: supply, demand, and the price that equalizes them. Since the housing is a durable good, the housing market can be divided into the primary (newly built housing) and secondary (used housing) markets. In addition, due to its relative expensiveness —the purchasing price can be many times higher than the annual income of the household— not everybody can afford buying a dwelling. This leads to a distinction between the owner- and tenant-occupied housing. At the same time, the housing is not an ordinary good. It is characterized by large complexity and heterogeneity. The immobile nature of housing creates strong dependence of its value on the place, where it is situated. All in all, the specificity of housing makes it an exciting object of investigation. This chapter is organized as follows. Section 3.2 serves as motivation for this chapter, for it demonstrates the importance of housing from the socio-economic standpoint.In section 3.3 we will focus on the specific features of housing as a good: heterogeneity, immobility, durability, and expensiveness. Sections 3.4 and 3.5 consider the housing demand and supply, respectively. In section 3.6, the housing prices and their long-term dynamics are discussed. Section 3.7 presents a stock-flow model of the housing market unifying all its aspects: the demand; the supply; and the housing price or rent that equate supply and demand. Section 3.8 is devoted to the availability of housing in various countries and compares them to Russia. In section 3.9, such measure of excess supply as housing vacancy is examined. Section 3.10 deals with the affordability of housing, that is, the ability of households to buy or rent a home. 3.2 The importance of housing The housing represents a large share of wealth of private households. Households spend a large part of their current expenses on housing. People, especially in countries with severe climate, stay most time in buildings. In addition, housing often serves as a symbol of status. In Russia, the housing has a particular importance. The main issue is the very insufficient availability of affordable and high-quality housing in Russia. The availability of housing (as measured by the living space per head) in Russia is two times smaller than in Western Europe and almost three times smaller than in the USA (see section 3.8). This problem is aggravated by the fact that the housing affordability (as measured by the ratio of incomes of an average household to the income it must have to purchase a standard dwelling using a mortgage loan provided at standard conditions) in Russia is, for example, four times lower than in the USA (Гусев 2008). This is confirmed by the results of the opinion surveys, which show that the most important problems of Russian citizens at the national level are: high housing prices, high utilities prices, and a near impossibility to buy housing.4 3.3 Housing market The housing as a good has several specific features that distinguish it from other goods. First, housing is very heterogeneous — it differs a lot in terms of size, layout, equipment, state, and location. Second, the housing is immobile — it is impossible (without huge expenses) to move it in space. There some exceptions, like boat houses (e.g., in Amsterdam, Berlin, and Paris) and mobile homes (widely spread in the USA). Third, the housing is durable — normally, it can be used for decades. The exceptions include temporary housing and huts of nomad people (e.g., iglu or yurt). Fourth, the housing is very expensive — it accounts for a large share of consumption and wealth of private households. Fifth, the costs of moving are very high: large financial and socio-psychological costs are associated with changing the residence, especially if people move between for a long distance. 3.3.1 Heterogeneity of housing The housing is a highly heterogeneous good — it varies a lot across different dimensions. The housing value can be represented as a combination of contributions of its features. Typically, two major types of housing characteristics are distinguished: structural and locational. The structural characteristics refer to the physical condition of the dwelling itself and the building wherein it is located. They include the size (e.g., total and living area, the number of rooms, the number of floors in the building as well as the floor in which the dwelling is located, the area of the land plot), the layout (e.g., several small rooms vs. one large room, connected or isolated rooms, joined or separate WC and bathroom, availability of balcony or loggia, etc.), the equipment (e.g., built-in kitchen, central or individual heating, air conditioning), the state (e.g., newly built vs. completely worn-out, luxury vs. poor), construction materials, and the energy consumption and type of energy. The locational characteristics describe all features of the housing related to its geographical location. They include the accessibility (e.g., the distance or the travel time to the central business district, the proximity to roads or public transit stops and stations), the socio-economic situation in the neighborhood (the income and cultural level, the unemployment and the crime rate in the neighborhood or city district in which the dwelling is located), the natural environment (the quality of air, the availability of the green spaces, the proximity of the sources of environmental pollution, the incidence of various diseases), and the state of neighbor houses (how well the nearby houses and adjacent land plots are kept). One related feature of the housing market is the information asymmetry between the seller and buyer of the housing. In case of such a complex and heterogeneous good, it is virtually impossible for the buyer to figure out all its relevant characteristics before he buys and starts to use it. Even then, some hidden deficiencies can be discovered only years after. These include, for example, the fungus of the walls (structural characteristics) or the fact that nearby railway station is going to be shut down in a few years (locational characteristics). 3.3.2 Immobility of housing In most cases, the housing is immobile, meaning that it is prohibitively difficult and expensive to move it from one place to another. Therefore, the real estate agents often joke that the three main factors affecting house prices are: location, location, and location. However, this joke contains a big grain of truth. Indeed, in many cases the value of the dwelling can be up to a half dependent on its location. The heterogeneity of housing implies a high degree of segmentation of housing markets. The housing submarkets are delineated by such characteristics as size, location, and quality. The local markets can be quite isolated from each other, especially if they are divided by the natural (rivers, mountains, etc.) or human made (railroads, highways, etc.) barriers. Such local isolation produces spatial heterogeneity of housing (local submarkets differ from each other, especially in terms of the price) and spatial dependence (the dwellings located next to each other are more related in terms of their values than dwellings located far apart). Section elaborates more on these issues and how they can be tackled with in order to accurately assess the value of the real estate. 3.3.3 Durability of housing The housing is a very durable good. It can serve for various decades or even centuries. However, over time, the housing wears and tears. Therefore, from time to time a refurbishment is needed. The number of existing dwellings or their area is called housing stock. The housing stock grows mainly through the new construction. Some part of housing is removed from the market. First, dwellings are converted to non-residential uses (e.g., offices, doctor’s practices). Second, the owners simply do not use it and leave vacant (empty) as a so-called \"concrete purse’’. This is done especially during the housing market booms, when the prices for housing increase, and the market participants expect to sell it at a later stage with a profit. In such a case, renting out of the housing is regarded as something burdensome. Third, when housing is worn out and not well maintained, it decays and becomes uninhabitable. Fourth, the housing is demolished, because it is too worn out or it is considered as an obstacle for the new developments (construction of new streets or larger buildings). One interesting phenomenon related to the durability of housing is the so-called filtering down. It means a transition of housing from the more expensive into a cheaper segment due to wear and obsolescence. Typically, the housing market is very segmented by different dimensions. One of the dimensions is the quality of housing. The higher-quality dwellings are more expensive and, therefore, are used by the better off persons, while lower-quality dwellings are inhabited by the poor people. Often, the investors are more interested in constructing high-quality dwellings that offer higher profits than the dwellings for poor. This can create problems with availability of affordable housing, since people with lower incomes are more populous. However, the good news is that the high-quality dwellings constructed years before through the wear and tear descend into the lower-quality segment. The rich people leave these dwellings and more into the newly built ones, whereas poor people can move in these \"filtered down’’ dwellings. This process —at least to some extent— mitigates the housing affordability issue. 3.3.4 Housing is expensive Another important feature of the housing is its high price. Despite all the standardization of the building materials and streamlining of the construction process, the modern housing is very expensive. The housing price by far and large exceeds the current income of the household. It can well be 3–4 times larger than the annual income. Therefore, the housing is mainly bought with borrowed money. This can be dangerous, if the dwelling is bought at a peak of a housing boom, which is followed by an abrupt price fall.5 In such a case, many house buyers with low or uncertain incomes can default and lose their property. In some countries, e.g., in Germany, the liability of mortgage debtors does not end with the sale of the house, instead the whole their wealth must be used to pay out their debts. If many people cannot fulfill their debt obligations, then the banks, which lent them money, get into troubles. Due to a strong interdependence of the banks this can lead to a systemic crisis of the whole banking system, which, in turn, can trigger a full-fledged economic downturn. This is a scenario that took place in 2008–2009 first in the USA and then in many other countries. The fact that the housing is very expensive generates a divide between people: some of them, who have another money to buy a dwelling, become homeowners, while the others must live in a rented housing. The choice between the own and the rental housing is known as a tenure choice. In more detail it will be considered in Chapter 6. Finally, the housing makes up the largest part of the private wealth. This means that the assets of the private households are mainly invested in their housing and, thus, are not really diversified. For example, in Germany, it accounts for more than a half of the wealth of private households. It share is well above the proportion of other assets, including cash and securities. In China, the proportion of the housing in the total wealth is even higher, corresponding to approximately 70%6 In Sweden, during the post-WWII period, the housing accounted for 50–75% of the wealth of private households (Berg 1988). Figure 3.1 depicts the structure of the fixed capital of Russia in 2015. Figure 3.1: Structure of Russia’s fixed capital, end of 2015 As seen, the value of residential buildings accounts for more than 40% and is about 138.8 trillion rubles. Figure 3.2 traces the evolution of the structure of the private wealth of France between 1700 and 2010. The value of four main assets (agricultural land, housing, other domestic capital, and net foreign assets) is expressed as percentage of the national income. Figure 3.2: National wealth of France, 1700–2010 Source: Piketty and Zucman (2014). While until the mid-19th century, the agricultural land in France used to be the largest asset, by the end of the 20th century the housing turned into the largest wealth component. 3.4 Demand for housing As in any other market, the effective demand for housing depends on the number of individuals requiring it and on their purchasing power. In case of the housing market, the individuals requiring dwellings are households. According, for example, to the definition of Rosstat, \"a household is a group of persons living in the same residential premises or part of them, who jointly provide themselves with food and all necessary stuff for their life, and completely or in part join and spend their money. These persons can can be unified by the kinship relations and relationships resulting from marriage, or do not be relatives, or be either one or another’’.7 Therefore, the demand for housing depends basically on the demographic factors and disposable income. However, the housing is a dual good: it can be used both for consumption (as a place to live) and for investment (as a store of value and possibility to make money). Hence, the demand for housing has the following determinants: demography (population, number of households, migration); disposable income; the opportunity cost (interest rate); and the price. 3.4.1 Demography The population growth leads to a rising need for housing. However, when population is constant or even declining, the demand for housing can still increase due to the growing number of households, because their size reduces. During 20th and 21st centuries, in European countries, including Russia, household sizes have been declining. Consider, for example, the population and households development in two countries with shrinking population: Germany and Russia in 2002–2010. In Germany, the population decreased by 1,0%, whereas number of households increased by 4,1%. In Russia, between 2002 and 2010, the average household size dropped from 2.7 to 2.6 persons, which led an increase of the number of private households from 52.7 to 54.6 million, that is, by 3.5%.8 At the same, the number of the private household members declined from 142.8 to 141.0 million, i.e., by 1.3%. During the same period, in the Russian urban areas, the number of the private households increased by 5.1%, with their population remaining almost unchanged, while the average household size decreased from 2.7 to 2.5. In many countries, the natural population growth is negative. It means that the number of deaths exceeds the number of births. In this case, the population growth can be achieved only through immigration. Figure 3.3 shows the net migration (immigration minus emigration) in Russia between 1991 and 2018. Figure 3.3: Net migration in Russia, 1991–2018 As seen, the net migration in Russia has been positive, sometimes —in the early 1990s— exceeding 800,000 persons. This inflow of foreign population in part offset the decline of population in the Russian Federation. Similarly, the migration has played an important role in the population growth of Germany in 1950–2019, as Figure 3.4 shows. Figure 3.4: Net migration in Germany, 1950–2019 The net migration to Germany underwent strong fluctuations in the post-WWII period. Two largest and the most recent surges in the net migration are related to the immigration from the former Soviet Union in the early 1990s and the refugee crisis of 2015. 3.4.2 Income The rise of the purchasing power is related to the increase of the real disposable income. Even if the number of private households remains unchanged, the increase in their welfare leads to the growing demand for housing. This means that the demand for more spacious and comfortable housing increases or people start demanding additional dwellings. For example, in Spain the so-called secondary dwellings () are widespread, which are typically purchased in the recreational areas as a supplement to the principal dwelling located in the area of the permanent residence of the owner. 3.5 Housing supply The supply of housing depends in the first place on its rate of return. Usually, the rate of return of housing is measured by the ratio of the net revenue from letting it out (rental revenue minus related expenses) to the amount of capital invested in purchasing it. The investors compare the expected rate of return of housing to the alternative forms of investment, which have the same or smaller risk. When the risk-weighted rate of return of investment in the housing market is equal to the risk-weighted rate of return of other assets, the investors are indifferent where to invest their capital. Typically, the rate of interest on bank deposits is considered as an alternative rate of return. If the interest rate increases, then, other things being equal, the willingness of investors to invest their capital in the housing market will diminish. Similar things happen when the expected rate of return on housing declines. This can be a result of a reduction of the housing price, cost increases, and rise of risk. The housing price decrease can be caused by the reduction of demand or by the saturation of the market. The costs can change as a result of the use of the new technologies (e.g., cheaper pre-engineered buildings), increasing energy saving standards (for example, the houses must have double or triple plastic windows and a special weatherization of walls), improvement of comfort (for instance, the availability of elevators or special equipment for elderly and disabled people), or shortage of the building materials and labor force (as result of construction growth or of its use for other, e.g., military purposes). The government can affect the building costs, for it is the government that introduces the norms of housing consumption, equipment, and energy saving, as well as changes the rate of return of the housing market. During the peacetime, the housing stock changes rather slowly. For example, in Russia, the stock of housing is large: in 2017, there were 65.9 million dwellings or 3.7 billion square meters. In comparison to the housing stock, the net increase of housing is small: between 2001 and 2017, the average annual increase of the Russian housing stock had been 1% in terms of the number of dwellings and by 1.6% in terms of the area. Figure 3.5 depicts the housing construction dynamics in several countries. The housing construction is measured by the number of completed dwellings (flats in the apartment buildings and single-family houses). Figure 3.5: Completed dwellings, 1950–2019 As seen, the residential construction has underwent strong fluctuations. On the one hand, they are related to the large-scale post-war reconstruction programs, especially in Germany and Russia. On the other hand, they result from cyclicity of the housing market. A big construction boom, which preceded the Great Recession 2008–2009 is very pronounced. This in particular true in case of Spain, where in the first half of the 2000s, 3–4 times more housing had been built than in Germany, despite the fact the population of Germany is double of that of Spain. This conditioned a very destructive contraction that followed. In Russia, the residential construction declined during the \"lost decade’’ of the 1990s, when as a result of the breakdown of the Soviet Union and badly designed policy of transition toward market economy, the nation incurred enormous material losses. Figure 3.6 displays the average annual residential construction intensity between 1900 and 2017. In fact, it covers an unbalanced panel of 62 countries. Figure 3.6: Completed dwellings per 1000 persons worldwide, 1900–2017 Sources: national statistical offices and own calculations. It compares the housing construction worldwide, in the former Socialist countries, and in Russia. As seen, the residential construction rapidly fell during both world wars and then strongly increased. The highest construction intensity had been observed between 1950 and 1990. During this period, Socialist countries demonstrated particularly high intensity of residential construction. Between 1990 and 2000, a large drop in the construction can be observed, which especially hard hit the former Socialist countries that engaged during that period on the way of transition. Another substantial decrease in the construction intensity took place in the wake of the Great Recession of 2008–2009. Interestingly, since 2010, Russia demonstrates a higher than the worldwide average intensity of residential construction, which, however, falls short of the level attained in the last years of the USSR, let alone the record levels attained in the late 1950s. 3.6 Housing prices The housing price allows establishing an equilibrium between the supply of and demand for housing. It performs a signalling function by informing the builders, landlords, and consumers about housing shortage or excess supply. Figure 3.7 shows the dynamics of the house prices in several OECD countries plus Russia between 1970 and 2020. Figure 3.7: Housing prices in selected countries, 1970–2020 All these housing price indices are set to 100% in 2015. A logarithmic scale is used in order to better see the relative increases of the prices. Germany demonstrates the lowest growth rates of housing prices over most part of the period. Russia experienced in the 1990s a very swift increase in the housing prices, which is related to the liberalization of its economy, privatization of the housing stock, and the hyperinflation. After 70 years of the centrally planned economy, where housing market was confined to a very narrow niche, virtually all residential properties became an object of buying and selling. Spain and the UK also had rapid house price increases, while the USA occupied an intermediate position. Around 2008, the upward trend was broken and in all countries, except for Germany, the prices fell down. After several years of stagnation, they started to recover. Figure 3.7 displays the nominal prices. Therefore, in part their increases can be explained by the overall inflation rates in each country. For instance, in Russia, the housing price increase in the 1990s is to a large extent due to its tremendous hyperinflation. Figure 3.8 accounts for this by presenting the real housing prices, that is, the nominal prices divided by the consumer price index and, thus, corrected for inflation. Figure 3.8: Real housing prices in selected countries, 1970–2020 The adjustment for inflation rates makes the house price cycles more visible. They take various lengths, varying from five to ten years and sometimes synchronized between countries. The adjustment of housing prices for the overall price level growth makes also pronounced a house price decline in Germany that lasted from the mid-1990s through 2010 and the current crisis of the Russian housing market, where real prices have fallen since 2014. The house price data presented above cover almost 50 years, in case of Russia — about 20 years. A very long-term evolution of real house prices in 14 advanced countries can be traced thanks to a database compiled by Knoll, Schularick, and Steger (2017); see Figure 3.9. It allows to see how strongly did the housing prices increase. Figure 3.9: Evolution of real house prices in 14 countries, 1870–2016, 1990=100 Source: Knoll, Schularick, and Steger (2017), http://www.macrohistory.net/data/. Between 1870 and 1950s, the real house prices stagnated. It is only since the 1950s, that they began to rapidly increase. The price of land plays a central role for the long-term evolution of house prices. Construction costs rose in the interwar period, increased substantially in 1950–1970, and then leveled off. 3.7 Housing market equilibrium The establishment of the housing market equilibrium can be illustrated using Figure 3.10, which depicts the standard stock and flow model. The left panel shows the housing stock, while the right panel displays the net change (flow) of the housing stock. Along the horizontal axis, the area of housing in square meters is plotted, whereas the vertical axis shows the rent per square meter. In the short run, the housing supply is determined by the available housing stock and is, therefore, completely inelastic. For this reason, the supply curves in the left panel are depicted as vertical straight lines. Figure 3.10: The stock-flow model In the right panel, the supply curve \\(S_{\\Delta H}\\) has a positive slope and denotes a net inflow of the housing into the market, \\(\\Delta H\\). When the housing rent, \\(r\\), is high, then the net inflow is positive. However, if the rent is low, then the net flow can be negative. This is related to the fact that the housing can not only appear on the market, but also disappear from it as a result of demolition, merger of several dwellings into one, etc. The net inflow of housing, \\(\\Delta H\\), represents a difference between the newly built and eliminated housing. When the rent \\(r\\) is high, much new housing is built and little old housing is demolished. However, when the housing rent is low, the rental revenues of the landlords decrease, which makes the construction of new housing less attractive and can induce the housing owners to neglect maintenance and even demolish the existing housing. In this case, the net inflow of housing becomes negative. When the housing rent equals \\(r_e\\), in the point, where curve \\(S_{\\Delta H}\\) intersects the vertical axis, the area of the newly built dwellings is equal to that of the eliminated dwellings; thus, the net inflow is zero leaving the housing stock unchanged. Initially, the housing stock equals \\(H_0\\). The demand for housing is represented by the curve \\(D\\) having negative slope. In the point of intersection of both lines, the housing rent is \\(r_0\\). At such rental price, the investors (developers) are ready to build \\(\\Delta H_1\\) square meters of housing. Therefore, in the next period, the supply curve will shift rightward, into the position \\(H_1=H_0+\\Delta H_1\\) and the rent decreased to \\(r_1\\). However, event in that case, the developers are still willing to erect additional housing, albeit less than in the previous period — \\(\\Delta H_2\\). Thus, the new residential construction will continue until the housing stock will increase up to \\(H_e\\) and the rental price will fall to \\(r_e\\). This will be an equilibrium level. The housing market will remain in the equilibrium until it will be distorted by some supply or demand shock. What kind of shocks can force the housing market out of its equilibrium? For example, an earthquake can destroy a part of the housing stock and, thus, cause a negative supply shock. In such a case, the long-run supply curve in the left panel will immediately shift leftward. This will lead to a rent increase, which will induce a new housing construction and, hence, gradual expansion of the housing stock. Migration can also affect the equilibrium. In case of negative net migration (emigration), the demand for housing decreases and the demand curve shifts leftward leading to a reduction of rent. By contrast, positive net migration (immigration) will lead to a rightward shift of demand curve causing rents to rise, which, in turn, will stimulate the developers to expand the new housing construction and slow down the removal of the existing housing units. What happens if the housing price changes? Suppose that the price increases. This increases the attractiveness of supplying more housing and can lead to the new construction; a slowdown of wearing through current repairs; and housing modernization implying a change of layout and a quality improvement of the existing housing. If the price decreases, then there is less or no new construction; the (rental) dwellings are converted to other (non-residential) uses; and more buildings are demolished. 3.8 Housing availability An important indicator of the housing market development is the availability of housing. It shows how much living space is available per person or household. Different countries have very different levels of housing availability. Figure 3.11 shows the distribution of housing stock in four countries (Germany, Russia, Spain, and the USA) by the number of rooms. Figure 3.11: Structure of housing stock by number of rooms, 2006–2011 Sources: national statistical offices and own calculations. Russia differs a lot from other countries. While in Russia, most dwellings has 2 rooms or less, in other three countries, the vast majority of dwellings have 4 rooms or more. Figure 3.12 depicts the dwelling sizes in 49 large European cities or capitals. Since no statistical data on the city level could be found, we use the data taken from the Internet advertisements of dwellings for sale. Surely, the structure of the advertized housing must not necessarily be identical to that of the existing total housing stock. Still, it can provide some useful insights in cross-city and cross-country differences. Figure 3.12: Size of dwellings in European cities, 2012 Sources: Internet advertisement on housing sales in various countries. As seen, the quality of advertised flats can vary substantially both across cities and time. Usually, it is correlated with the welfare level, culture, and availability of the free space in each city. For example, flats in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) are typically smaller (50-60 m\\(^2\\) and 2 rooms), whereas in Western Europe they are much larger (70-90 m\\(^2\\) and 3 rooms), see Figure 3.12, where the CEE cities are denoted by red color. One notable exception is Paris, where a typical flat is about 60 m\\(^2\\) large and has 2 rooms. One can even find the ads of flats as small as 9 m\\(^2\\), which are offered for exorbitant prices in Paris. It is difficult to imagine something like this in Berlin. The flats in cities of non-continental and Nordic countries are also relatively small. The largest flats (about 110 m\\(^2\\) and more than 3 rooms) can be found in Lisbon and Istanbul. Table 3.1 reports several indicators characterizing the housing availability in selected countries. Table 3.1: Housing availability in selected countries Country Average dwelling size Surface per person total housing stock square meters Surface per person newly completed dwellings square meters Years needed for Russia to catch up Germany 91.1 42.7 0.25 86 Russia 53.2 23.0 0.48 Spain 92.4 35.7 0.24 53 UK 92.3 49.3 USA 139.4 65.0 0.45 1401 Sources: National statistical offices and own calculations. In 2010–2014, in Russia, the average dwelling was almost two times smaller than in European countries and almost three times smaller than in the USA. The gap between Russia and other countries in terms of surface per person is even larger. However, in case of the newly built dwellings, the surface per capita in Russia is much larger than in Germany and Spain and is comparable to that in the USA. This implies that, if the difference will remain, then, as follows from equation (3.1), in 53 years the surface per capita will attain the same level as in Spain, in 86 years that of Germany, and in 1401 years that in the USA. The number of years Russia would need to catch up developed countries in terms of surface per capita can be computed as follows: \\[\\begin{equation} CT_t = \\frac{HS^i_t - HS_t^{RU}}{\\Delta HS_t^{RU}-\\Delta HS_t^i} \\tag{3.1} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(HS^i_t\\) is the floor area per person in country \\(i\\) in year \\(t\\); \\(HS^{RU}_t\\) is the floor area per person in Russia in year \\(t\\); \\(\\Delta HS^i_t\\) is the net per-capita change of floor area in country \\(i\\) in year \\(t\\); and \\(\\Delta HS^{RU}_t\\) is the net per-capita change of floor area in Russia in year \\(t\\). Figure 3.13 compares the average surface (in m\\(^2\\)) of the newly built housing in Germany and Russia in 1956–2017. Figure 3.13: Average surface of new dwellings in Russia and Germany, 1956–2019 It can be seen that, during the last 60 years, the housing availability has improved, as reflected in the average per-capita surface. This process is characteristic for both Germany and Russia, although the housing availability in Germany was and still is much better than in Russia. The absolute gap is almost unchanged at about 30 m\\(^2\\). After the Great Recession of 2008–2009, both countries has experienced a reduction of the size of the newly built dwellings. This can be explained by two factors: 1) shrinking household sizes (a small family needs a small dwelling); 2) low income levels (many Russians can only afford buying a \"microapartment’’ of 20–30 m\\(^2\\), albeit it will not allow them to satisfy their housing requirements to a full extent). Figure 3.14 displays the average surface per capita of the newly built and existing housing in Russia between 1956 and 2017. Figure 3.14: Average surface of new dwellings in Russia and Germany, 1956–2019 It shows that between 1991 and 2017 the average surface per capita of the existing housing stock increased from about 50 to 56 m\\(^2\\). This is a result of the growing sizes of new dwellings. Moreover, the difference between the surface of the newly built and existing housing widened from about 10 to about 13 m\\(^2\\). 3.9 Housing vacancy Normally, the housing stock is not fully used. There are almost always dwellings that stay vacant. This is similar to the labor market, where some people are unemployed, or to the capital stock, where the production capacities are not fully utilized. The housing vacancy is the part of housing stock, which is unused: \\[\\begin{equation} V = S - D \\end{equation}\\] where \\(V\\) is number of vacant dwellings; \\(S\\) is the effective housing supply; and \\(D\\) is the housing demand. The vacancy rate is defined as: \\[\\begin{equation} v = \\frac{V}{S} \\end{equation}\\] According to the natural vacancy rate hypothesis, the housing rents are driven by deviations of the vacancy rate from its equilibrium (\"natural’’) levels (Rosen and Smith 1983). The estimates of natural vacancy rate provide useful information for investors, lenders, etc. The comparison of natural rate, \\(v^*\\), to the actual vacancy rate, \\(v\\), provides indication of future rent movements. The natural vacancy rate affects the return on the property investment. In the long-run equilibrium, a falling natural vacancy rate leads to an increase of the amount of rent generated by a rental property and, thus, of the return on rental property investment. The demand for housing can be defined as: \\[\\begin{equation} D^H = d(R, U, Y, P, Z) \\end{equation}\\] where \\(R\\) is nominal rent; \\(U\\) is user cost of homeownership; \\(Y\\) is the real income; \\(P\\) is the housing price; and \\(Z\\) is a vector of demographic variables (e.g., the number and size of households, the age composition of population). The equation for the vacancy rate can be expressed as: \\[\\begin{equation} v = \\frac{V}{S} = 1 - \\frac{1}{S}d(R, U, Y, P, Z) \\end{equation}\\] The rent adjustment: \\[\\begin{equation} r = f(e, v-v^*) \\end{equation}\\] where \\(r\\) is rate of change of nominal rent; \\(e\\) is rate of change of operating expenses; and \\(v^*\\) is natural vacancy rate. The natural vacancy rate varies strongly from country to country, as seen in Table 3.2; see, for example, Rink and Wolff (2015) for Germany and Wilhelmsson, Andersson, and Klingborg (2011) for Sweden. This must be taken into account, when forecasting rent. Table 3.2: Natural vacancy rate in selected countries Country Natural vacancy rate percent Germany 3 Sweden 1 Switzerland 1 USA 5 In Germany, a vacancy rate exceeding 3% is regarded as a sign of a “relaxed’’ housing market, where every person looking for a dwelling can without problem find it. In the USA, such a vacancy rate would point to a stressed housing market, characterized by an excessive housing demand. By the German and US standards, Switzerland appears to function at the almost full”employment’’ of housing for the last 80 years, as seen in Figure 3.15. Figure 3.15: Vacancy rates in Switzerland, 1937–2019 Due to changes in the statistical definitions, several measures of vacancy rate are used. As the period between 1950 and 1990 shows, the biggest cities have the largest housing shortage. For the USA, two vacancy rates are available: for rental and for owner-occupied dwellings; see Figure 3.16, which shows quarterly data covering the period 1956–2017. Figure 3.16: Vacancy rates in the USA, 1956–2020 The vacancy rate for the rental dwellings substantially (by almost six percentage points) exceeds that for the owner-occupied dwellings. This can reflect the higher mobility of the tenants. Both vacancy rates have a slight upward trend and display cyclical fluctuations, which coincide with those of the real housing prices. For example, the Great Recession 2008–2009 resulted in large jump of the vacancy rate for owner-occupied dwellings. Many home buyers faced the impossibility of paying their mortgage loans and left their houses to the banks. Large-scale defaults inundated the housing market, so that many dwellings stayed empty, for the banks could not find persons willing to buy these properties. Surprisingly, in 2020, the COVID-19 crisis led to a dramatic decline in vacancy rates. 3.10 Housing affordability Housing is a very expensive good. Both purchasing and renting the housing costs a lot of money. The concept of housing affordability reflects the ability of market participants (above all the private households) to obtain access as owner or as tenant to the housing. 3.10.1 Purchasing of housing The affordability of housing from the point of view of a home buyer, is usually measured by the price-to-income ratio. It corresponds to the number of years of (usually, median) income it would take to buy a home. Thus, the higher the ratio, the less affordable the housing. Figure 3.17 shows the housing price-to-income ratio for the USA between 1987 and 2017. It is based on the median prices of existing single-family home and median household income. Figure 3.17: Price-to-income ratio in the USA, 1987–2018 Sources: Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, National Association of Realtors, and own calculations. On average, the price-to-rent ratio is about 3.4 years. In 2006, it achieved its maximum of 4.6 years. Figure 3.18 depicts the evolution of the price-to-income ratio in Russia between 1998 and 2017. The price is that for the dwellings with the surface of 50 m\\(^2\\) sold at the primary and secondary markets. Instead of the median income, which is typically used in computing this ratio, we use the average household income, for there are no data on the median income. Given that the average income tends to be higher than the median income, the index is underestimated. Here, we assume that two household members are working and earning the same income. In addition, it is assumed that both new and second-hand dwellings have the same size, which is not true in reality as Figure 3.14 shows. Figure 3.18: Price-to-income ratio in Russia, 1998–2019 The housing price-to-income ratio in Russia used to be substantially higher than that, say, in the USA. The good news is that the trend is declining, which means an improving affordability of housing: While in 1998, it took 10 years of income to buy a home, in 2017, it decreased to \"just’’ 3.5 years, which is comparable with the levels observed in developed countries. To a large extent, this improvement is due to the increasing nominal income. It should also be taken into account that the dwellings in developed countries are much larger than in Russia. Thus, if we took the dwellings of identical sizes, we would have obtained a much lower affordability for Russia. Figure 3.19 compares the indices of price-to-income ratios in several countries. Figure 3.19: Price-to-income ratio in selected countries, 1970–2020 The indices are set to 100 in 2010. Thus, they do not allow to see the \"absolute affordability’’, only its dynamics. In most selected countries, the ratios steadily fluctuate in accordance with housing price bubbles. In Russia, the index increased until 2008–2009, when the affordability of housing was the lowest, and since then has been decreasing, which points out to the improving affordability. In Germany, the index was declining until the same inflection point as Russia —the Great Recession— and is climbing up. The price-to-income ratio is a simple to compute measure, which does not require too much information. Its weakness consists in ignoring the mortgage interest rate: The higher the rate the longer the payment period. An alternative measure of affordability of owner-occupied housing is the housing affordability index (HAI), which takes care of it. It is the ratio of the qualifying income (the part of income that can be spent on paying out a mortgage debt without endangering other expenses of the household) to the mortgage payment (interest and principal repayment). Formally, \\[\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:HAI} HAI = 100\\frac{q Y}{P} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(q\\) is the qualifying ratio for monthly mortgage loan expense to gross monthly income (for example, 25%, because typically a household can afford spending one-fourth of its income on paying out the loan); \\(Y\\) is the gross monthly income; and \\(P\\) is the monthly payment related to the mortgage loan and including interest and principal. \\(P\\) is computed using the annuity formula as follows: \\[\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:Annuity} P = M\\frac{(1+i)^T i}{(1+i)^T-1} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(M\\) is the amount of the mortgage loan, defined as the value of property, \\(V\\), minus down payment, \\(D\\) (\\(M=V-D\\)); \\(i\\) is the mortgage interest rate; and \\(T\\) is the maturity period of the mortgage loan (e.g., 10 or 20 years) during which the loan is completely paid out. In 2005, according to Гусев (2008), the HAI in Russia was 28.9% for the primary housing market and 33.4% for the secondary market, while for the USA the HAI was 111.8%. What does it mean? First, in Russia, a household having an average income could not afford taking a standard mortgage loan% in order to purchase a home with a total surface of 54 m\\(^2\\): Its income was sufficient to cover only up to one-third of the payments associated with the loan. Second, a US household earning a median income was able without any problem to serve a standard (for the USA) mortgage loan and, thus, to buy a standard home, which is likely to be much more spacious than its Russian counterpart. Third, the housing affordability in 2005 in the USA was four times higher than in Russia. Using the same assumptions9 as Гусев (2008), we arrive at the following estimates of HAI for Russia in 2017: 54.7% for the primary and 59.5% for the secondary housing market. In 2017, the US HAI increased to about 159%.10 Thus, the affordability improved in both countries, in Russia somewhat more. Therefore, within 12 years the gap reduced from 4 to 3 times, which is still a lot. Moreover, at least a half of the Russian households still have not enough income to afford buying an average size dwelling even with a borrowed money. Figure 3.20 displays the spatial distribution of the housing affordability index by regions of the Russian Federation in 2017. It is computed for the same dwelling surface (54 m\\(^2\\)), down payment ratio (20%), and qualifying ratio (25%), whereas mortgage interest rates, housing prices, and money incomes are region specific. Figure 3.20: Housing affordability index by regions of Russia, 2017 Sources: Central Bank of Russia, Rosstat, and own calculations. The HAI in Russia varies between 25 and 101%. It is the highest in Nenets autonomous okrug — a northern region, where income levels are high, while the mortgage interest rate is the lowest. In most regions, the HAI lies between 45 and 65%. Figure 3.21 shows the housing affordability index in European cities. The index is computed using the Numbeo cost-of-living data.11 The HAI is calculated for an apartment having a total surface of 70 \\(m^2\\) and located outside of city center. In addition, the Numbeo database contains data on an average monthly net salary (after tax) and a mortgage interest rate, which are taken advantage of in our calculations. The loan maturity is 20 years, the down payment ratio is 20%, and servicing share is 25%. Figure 3.21: Housing affordability index in European cities, 2020 Sources: Numbeo and own calculations. A clear divide between Eastern and Western Europe can be seen: while in the East, the affordability of housing is very low, it is much higher in the West. The most affordable housing is to be found in Finland, Germany, The Netherlands, and Switzerland. To a large extent this can be explained by higher incomes and much lower interest rates in the West. 3.10.2 Renting of housing The housing expenditure is one of the largest, if not the largest, components of the consumption of private households. During the 20st century in many countries, the housing expenses have taken over the first place in the ranking of consumption expenditure, which was previously occupied by the food expenses. Figure 3.22 shows the structure of the household consumption expenditure by the main items in 2010. Figure 3.22: Main consumption expenditures of households 2010 Sources: Bureau of Labor Statistics; Eurostat; Rosstat; and own presentation. In the Western countries, the share of housing expenditure, which along with the housing rent includes utilities payments (water, electricity, heating, etc.), represents the largest component of the private household budget. In Russia, it occupies the third position, while the food and clothing expenditures are on the first and the second positions, respectively. While in the Western countries, the share of housing expenses varies between 20 and 35% (the share of housing rent, also denoted as rent burden, is lower), in Russia it is below 10%. Note that the inverse of the price-to-rent ratio is the gross rental yield, that is, the rate of return on housing. Figure 3.23 displays the evolution of the share of housing expenditure in Russia between 1970 and 2015. Figure 3.23: Share of housing expenditure in Russia, 1970–2019 During the late Soviet period, most Russian citizens lived in the cities in the rental dwellings. At that time, the main landlord was the state and the rents were controlled at an artificially low levels. This explains a very low and stagnating rent burden between 1970 and 1990. In the early 1990s, most part of the housing stock was in the municipal ownership and the rents for the municipal dwellings were fixed in order to prevent the social turmoil. By contrast, other consumer prices were liberalized and rose enormously during the hyperinflation period. This explains the plummeting rent burden in the first half of the 1990s. Since then, the rental share significantly increases, although it still does not attain the levels observed in the Western countries. Using the so-called Schwabe’s law (Schwabesches Gesetz) the economists describe a negative relation between the income and the rent burden often observed in the empirical studies: the poorer the person (household) the larger the share of housing expenditure in his total expenditure. This empirical regularity was observed by a German statistician Hermann Schwabe (1830–1874); see Schwabe (1868). This is similar to the so-called Engel law, according to which the share of food expenditure diminishes as the income increases. Figure 3.24 depicts an Engel curve for housing. Figure 3.24: Engel curve for housing The thick lines are the indifference curves defined for housing, \\(h\\), and some non-housing good, \\(x\\). The thin straight lines denote the budget lines: \\(y=p_x x + p_h h\\), where \\(y\\) is the household’s income; \\(p_x\\) is the price of an aggregate consumer good; and \\(p_h\\) is the rental price of housing. For simplicity, let us normalize the rental price of housing to \\(p_h=1\\). The tangency points of the indifference curves and budget lines denote the combinations of \\(h\\) and \\(x\\) the household can afford at the respective budget constraints (income levels). The thick green line that goes through the tangency points is the Engel curve. It demonstrates that at the higher income levels, the household can buy more of both \\(h\\) and \\(x\\). However, the share of rental expenditure in the total expenditure, \\(\\frac{h}{h+p_x x}\\), diminishes as the income increases. Why should the rent burden decline with the increasing income? One explanation is that housing is one of the basic needs (warmth, rest, and safety), in accordance with the Maslow’s hierarchy of needs. As income gets higher, the individual satisfies his basic needs and starts spending more on the higher-level needs. Therefore, the share of rental expenses decreases. An important objection to this logic is that the dwelling can also satisfy higher needs (e.g., prestige). Indeed, the rich people tend to buy dwellings that are qualitatively much better than those the poor people can afford. This can lead to the violations of the Schwabe’s law. Exercises Draw the stock-flow model diagrammatically. What happens, if the income decreases? Illustrate this graphically. Which of the following characteristics are structural and which are locational: poverty rate, number of floors in the building, central heating, noise level, number of trees, spatial density of hairdressers, travel time to the city center?

["ch-Valuation.html", "Chapter 4 Housing valuation 4.1 Introduction 4.2 Real estate valuation", " Chapter 4 Housing valuation 4.1 Introduction This chapter is devoted to the assessment of the real estate. Section 4.2 explains, why we need to assess the value of properties. In section 4.2 Real estate valuation 4.2.1 Motivation Why valuation of the real estates is needed? There are several reasons why people should bother assessing the value of the property, which are thoroughly discussed below. First, it is important to evaluate the just compensation in compulsory acquisition. Even in the free market economies, the authorities sometimes confiscate the property of the citizens. This can be related, for example, to the construction of a new road or a hydroelectric plant. Typically, the owners receive compensation for the real estate they lose. However, is this compensation fair? Or is the price offered by the authorities far below what your property is worth? Second, the knowledge about the property value is necessary for the fair taxation. In most countries, the owners of the real estate pay property taxes on the annual basis. In Russia, for instance, the value of each property is registered in the cadastre. The authorities using certain methodology and information about characteristics of the real estate estimate its taxable value. Is this value fair or is it set to high, since it does not take into account some important factors reducing the true value of the property? Third, the information about the value of the real estate is needed for the market transactions. For example, you want to buy or sell a dwelling. In that case, you have to know its fair market price. If you buy the dwelling, you do not want to pay a price that is too high. In case you sell it, you have to be sure that the price you are paid is not too low. Fourth, property can be bought using borrowed money or used as security in order to obtain a mortgage loan. Both the bank lending money and the borrower need to know the fair value of the property. What happens, if the assessment was wrong? In case of bank, this can lead to the impossibility to recover the lent money, if the borrower defaults. In case of the borrower, the failure to assess the real estate correctly can lead to a lower amount of loan. "],

In section 5.2, we will define the speculative bubbles and discuss their importance for the society. In section 5.3, a typology of the early warning systems is presented. In section 5.4, the techniques, which allow dating the periods of expansions (bubbles) and recessions (no bubbles) are presented. 5.2 Speculative bubbles The trajectory of the market economy is not smooth. From time to time, the economy experiences booms and crises. The examples of large crises include the Great Depression 1929–1932 that took place worldwide and to some extent was responsible for the outbreak of World War II; the Lost Decade (1991–2000 or even 1991–2010) in Japan; as well as the Great Recession, or Financial Crisis, 2008–2009 and the COVID-19 sanitary and economic crisis of 2019 that shook virtually entire world. In many cases, the economic crises are triggered by the speculations. The speculation can be defined as purchasing an asset not for own use but with an expectation that its price will increase further and that the asset can be sold at a later stage in order to realize capital gains. Speculations arise because financial capital is looking for ways of earning profit. It cannot lie idle, so the capital holders are always screening various markets in order to find those having the highest profit margin. So, speculations can emerge in virtually any market. From the early economic history, we know examples of speculating with tulip bulbs —the so-called \"tulip mania’’— in The Netherlands in the 1630s. Speculations with stocks are also known at least from the early 18th century, such as the Mississippi Bubble 1718–1720 and the South Sea bubble of 1719–1720. See, for example, Garber (1990). In 2001, a large crisis occured at the stock market, which was related to the speculations with stocks of the nascent Internet companies and, therefore, was nicknamed the DotCom crisis. The housing also often becomes an object for speculations. For example, the Great Recession 2008–2009 was mainly triggered by the speculations with subprime mortgage loans in the USA. The speculative asset price bubble is defined as \"large, sustained mispricings of financial or real assets’’ . Alternatively, the speculative bubbles refer to the periods in which the price of an asset exceeds its fundamental value due to investors’ beliefs that they can sell the asset at a higher price in the future. The fundamental value of an asset is its value determined by its dividend stream. By contrast, the speculative component of the asset’s value is that based on the expectations of reselling it at a higher price. How do the economists explain the emergence of speculative price bubbles? There are several well-established theories that explain seemingly unsustainable developments by rational behavior of agents (Brunnermeier 2008; Brunnermeier and Oehmke 2013; Glaeser and Nathanson 2015). Brunnermeier and Oehmke (2013) provide a classification of the existing approaches to explaining the buildup of asset price bubbles. They distinguish between five types of theories. The first explanation is the rational bubbles theory. It is argued that investors hold bubble assets since they expect the price of the asset to grow under the assumption that any investor in the future also expects asset price increases, even if the bubble may burst with a certain probability. Price increases then become self-fulfilling prophecies, which implies explosive growth of asset valuations (Blanchard and Watson 1982). Second, overlapping generations models allow the existence of bubbles, because they can restore efficiency of an economy, which is inherently not Pareto optimal (Tirole 1985). The idea is that even fiat money —which has no intrinsic value— can have a positive price because it is a store of value. Storing value, and thus increasing the price of money, might be a rational option in situations of over-accumulation of private capital, i.e., when capital accumulation exceeds the \"golden rule.’’ Then, transferring capital to future generations and giving fiat money a positive price (which is then a bubble asset) can increase economic efficiency. Third, the persistence of bubbles can be explained in the framework of the informational frictions theory. In this type of model, two sources of risk are introduced that encourage traders to invest in bubble assets. On the one hand, the fundamental risk arises from uncertainty of an unexpected jump of the fundamental value. In this case, investors who bet against a bubble lose money. On the other hand, risk-neutral traders, who are aware of the bubble, can still trade in order to benefit from speculative price increases, as long as they weigh the risk of a bursting bubble less than the chances of price increases (Abreu and Brunnermeier 2003). In both cases, investors delay the bursting of the bubble and allow it to grow even larger. Fourth, according to the delegated investment theory, most households delegate the management of their assets to the fund managers, who often are concerned only about short-run price movements (Shleifer and Vishny 1997) and may have incentives to buy overpriced assets (Allen and Gorton 1993). Fifth, the theory of the heterogeneous-beliefs bubbles implies that investors, possibly due to psychological biases, have different beliefs about the future. These beliefs when combined-with short-sale constraints-can lead to overpricing when optimists push up prices, while pessimists are unable to counteract this (Miller 1977). Regardless of the driving forces behind a bubble, house price bubbles can be defined as periods in which housing prices run well above their fundamental values, i.e., the development of rents. In addition, as pointed out by Brunnermeier and Oehmke (2013), asset values grow explosively during speculative bubble periods. While the notion ``well above’’ is rather open to interpretation, an explosive house price growth can be formally tested using statistical methods. An important role in the formation of speculative asset price bubbles is played by the financialization. The financialization can be defined as a way of capital accumulation, when profit-making takes place increasingly through financial channels rather than through trade and production (Aalbers 2016). Due to the slowdown of economic growth, the capital accumulation becomes more and more focused on the growth of finance, benefiting the financial markets agents (investors) rather than the real economy. The financialization embraces increasingly the non-financial firms (Internet, car industry, real estate sector, etc.) and households forcing them to accept risks and act as capitalists. It became a means of the capital switching in the sense of Harvey (1985), which channels the capital from the primary circuit (production, manufacturing, industrial sector), secondary (built environment for production, e.g., infrastructure, and for consumption, e.g., housing), or tertiary circuit (social infrastructure, i.e., investment in technology, science, conditions of employees, health and education) to the quaternary circuit of capital (Aalbers 2016). This capital switching inevitably leads to over-accumulation and to crises. The crises are costly — they destroy jobs and wealth. The bursting bubbles and resulting crises lead to huge GDP losses, increases in unemployment, bankruptcies of firms and private households, and other negative consequences for the whole society or its important parts. Therefore, it is important to be able to foresee them. If we will be able to identify timely the arrival of crises, then we can hope to mitigate their negative consequences. 5.3 Early warning system An early warning system is a tool for forecasting the booms and crises. It has two main elements: 1) an expansion/recession (boom/bust) dates, or bubble chronology; and a forecasting model. In the first step, the periods of bubbles and no bubbles, or expansions and recessions are established. In the second, step a forecasting model is estimated, which allows predicting the bubbles. Figure 5.1 depicts a typology of different early warning systems. Figure 5.1: Early warning system It distinguishes between the early warning systems with exogenous and endogenous chronologies. In the EWS with exogenous chronology, the determination of the bubble chronology step is done separately and independently on the forecasting step, while in the EWS with endogenous endogenous both these steps are carried out simultaneously. Figure 5.1 displays three families of methods used in order to establish the bubble chronology (ad hoc approach, expert judgment, and statistical testing), two families of forecasting techniques requiring exogenous chronologies (signalling approach and discrete-choice models), and three forecasting methods with endogenous chronology (TAR, STAR, and Markov switching). Below we will discuss each of these methods in more detail. 5.4 Dating the speculative bubbles Nobody knows when exactly do the speculative bubbles (or expansions and recessions in case of business cycles) start and end. In fact, what we observe are periodic declines and increases of asset prices or economic performance. However, without special techniques it is impossible to tell apart small short-lived fluctuations from the cyclical movements. Therefore, some algorithm is needed in order to establish the chronology of bubbles or business cycles. As shown in Figure , there are three families of methods establishing bubble chronologies: 1) expert judgment; 2) ad hoc dating; and 3) formal statistical tests. 5.4.1 Expert judgment A group of experts decides on the dates of beginning and ending of booms and busts. The most known such a group is the NBER’s Business Cycle Dating Committee.12 It maintains a chronology of the U.S. business cycle. The chronology comprises alternating dates of peaks and troughs in economic activity. The way the experts make their dating decisions is perfectly described by the NBER itself: The Committee applies its judgment… and has no fixed rule to determine whether a contraction is only a short interruption of an expansion, or an expansion is only a short interruption of a contraction. The NBER does not have a fixed definition of economic activity. It examines and compares the behavior of various measures of broad activity: real GDP, economy-wide employment, and real income. The NBER also can consider indicators that do not cover the entire economy, such as real sales and the Fed’s index of industrial production. A well-defined peak or trough in real sales or industrial production helps to determine overall peak or trough dates, particularly if the economy-wide indicators are in conflict or do not have well-defined peaks or troughs. Figure 5.2 plots the US real GDP together with the NBER business cycle chronology depicted as shaded areas. Figure 5.2: US real GDP vs. NBER chronology, 1947–2020 Sources: FRED, NBER, and own representation. It can be seen that the NBER chronology accurately picks up the declines in the real GDP. An especially deep and protracted decline is observed in 2008–2009, the episode known as the Great Recession. The NBER is an established authority and its chronology is a widely recognized one. Other countries have no such expert committee at the national level. Fortunately, there is an international organization — Economic Cycle Research Institute (ECRI), which produces business cycle chronologies for various countries.13 Each technique has its advantages and disadvantages. What are the strengths and weaknesses of the expert judgment approach? It has the following advantages: Experts make use of different sources of information. The wise judgment can be superior to a thoughtless use of sophisticated techniques. The disadvantages of the expert judgment approach to dating the bubbles are as follows: The expert’s procedure is not transparent. It is impossible to replicate. It is a very time consuming process: it takes many months or even years to identify the cyclical phases. 5.4.2 Ad hoc dating methods The simplest method of dating business cycles and speculative asset price bubble is the rule of thumb using the two-quarter definition. According to this rule, recession is defined as two consecutive quarters of decline in real GDP. A more sophisticated technique is the procedure developed by Bry and Boschan (1971). It tries to emulate the decision making process of the NBER using the monthly series of industrial production. The Bry-Boschan technique does not use any formal statistical framework to do the dating. Instead it translates the NBER method into a set of simple decision rules. It basically comprises two stages: 1) selecting the candidates for turning points and 2) applying a censoring rule to eliminate the turning points, which do not satisfy some criteria (e.g., minimum duration). A quarterly version of Bry-Boschan technique was developed by Harding and Pagan (2001). Each point in the sample is checked for being a local maximum or minimum: \\[\\begin{equation} y_t=\\left\\{ \\begin{array}{l} \\mbox{peak, if } y_t=\\max\\big(y_{t-K}, \\ldots, y_{t+L}\\big)\\\\ \\mbox{trough, if } y_t=\\min\\big(y_{t-K}, \\ldots, y_{t+L}\\big)\\\\ \\mbox{neither peak nor trough, otherwise} \\end{array} \\right. \\end{equation}\\] Normally, one takes \\(K=L=2\\) for quarterly data (6 for monthly data). Eliminate candidate peaks and troughs, which do not satisfy two restrictions: 1) minimum phase duration should be 6 months (2 quarters) and 2) complete cycle must last at least 15 months (5 quarters). The most important appeal of the Bry-Boschan technique is its simplicity and transparency. It is also very robust in the sense that changing the sample will not affect the dates. Although it is sensitive to the choice of criteria and censoring rules. Arbitrariness is the major problem related to the ad hoc techniques. Crises occurring at the currency markets have their specific features and, therefore, require somewhat different tools in order to identify them. A currency crisis is defined as speculative pressures in foreign exchange markets. In order to identify the periods of a currency crisis, constructed crisis indices need to reflect both successful and unsuccessful speculative attacks on domestic currency. Following Eichengreen, Rose, and Wyplosz (1994) recent studies use as crisis indicator the speculative exchange market pressure (EMP), which is a weighed average of depreciation rate of nominal exchange rates, percentage change in international reserves, and change in interest rate. Different weighting schemes are possible. For example, it is reasonable to use for this purpose the inverse of the standard deviations of the component variables (\\(\\frac{1}{\\sigma_i}\\), where \\(i=\\{\\text{exchange rate}, \\text{reserves}, \\text{interest rate}\\}\\)) in order to equalize their volatilities.
